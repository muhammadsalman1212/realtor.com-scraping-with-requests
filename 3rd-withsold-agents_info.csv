By now, you've probably read quite a few real estate bios and tons of reviews in your search for the ""perfect agent."" As I'm sure you have found, it's a lot of bragging phrases, such as ""Million Dollar Producer,"" which doesn't define how that would help you buy or sell a home. At the end of the day, it's not about the agent. It's about YOU and what I can do to help you.

I attended Bishop Chatard High School and went on to study Marketing, Accounting, and Finance at Marian University, where I was fortunate enough to be on the Marian Softball team. Through sports, school, and extra-curricular activities, I learned to work hard. My passion for real estate developed at a young age. I've been ""showing houses,"" since I was nine years old. I spent Sunday's ""working"" beside my mom and showing houses with her clients, and I loved it. After college, I went straight into a public accounting firm as an auditor. I learned a ton in my auditing days, but the few things that stuck with me was how to problem solve quickly, be concise with your responses, and be authentic.  I feel I have carried these traits with me into real estate, and they have helped me become the agent I am today. They are a crucial part of my communication skills that help keep me in tune with my clients and help create a better real estate experience.",Melissa Coutz,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d8a043399d23f3f938db955f65bb989ca-e568004110s.jpg,(317) 513-5092,(317) 800-7075

Hello, I'm Ashley Wright, an Indianapolis native and currently residing in Morgan County. My Indiana home has always held a special place in my heart, and I consider it to be on the best states to live in! So much to be apart of! 

I started working in real estate in 2013 as a real estate assistant and obtained my real estate license later that same year.  I have experience working with buyers, sellers, builders, investors, first time home owners, veterans, and relocating buyers and sellers.

In the office, I'm known for my willingness to teach and help new agents and driven commitment to quality service. I have an easy to work with attitude but assertive work ethic that provides a positive and efficient experience in home buying and selling. I work well with construction crews and homeowners alike to create the home of their dreams. I believe in a team building environment; good relationships with clients and co-workers are the building blocks to a high profit margin for both the investor and business owner.

In my first year of real estate, I was able to outsell other rookies in my field and sold 4 times more than the average first year agent. Since then, I have sold over 160 homes totaling over 30 million dollars in real estate!  Trusting me to take care of your home and investment can be a large undertaking, and I am proficient in reducing that stress. Our admin team works in-house instead of contracting it out, which allows communication to be quick and efficient for everyone involved.

I love giving back to the community, whether that's my job duties serving on the board at the Boys and Girls Club of Morgan County, or my passion for Public Servants through our Homes for Heros Program benefiting veterans, law enforcement, teachers, doctors, and nurses. I enjoy teaching free home buying classes to first time home buyers and law enforcement graduates.You'll often find me doing  locally owned or Indiana based activities such as Splash Island, Turkey Run, Pioneer Park, Indianapolis Zoo, Pine Lake, and Anderson Orchard with my children.

My husband and I enjoy raising my four beautiful children in the Mooresville Area and we are fully engaged in all the Morgan County has to offer our family! I hope to share all the positive opportunities with newcomers and embrace our incredible resources. If you are considering buying, selling, renting, or investing in Central Indiana, I will be a great resource for locations, investments and quality of life. I'd love the opportunity to work with you; call or email me to start discussing the options today.",Ashley Wright,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1484744769/ae250d94f9c79817f16f91a49567e042a-e0s.jpg,(317) 366-4983

My funniest experience so far was when I was showing a large home that did not have power in the basement.  My client turned the corner in the dark basement, and in the mirror above the bar, written in dust, was “I am watching you”.   Because it was a mirror, her reflection in the dim light made it look like someone was watching her!  She jumped at least 6 feet, ran out of the house, and now references the house as the “ghost house”.

4,"260 1st Avenue South, Suite 200",Saint Petersburg,"I grew up amidst the rolling fields and friendly communities of Indiana which laid the foundation for my values and sense of community. The Hoosier state instilled in me a love for the simple pleasures of life. However, as life's journey unfolded, I found myself drawn to the diverse opportunities that Florida had to offer. Relocating to the Sunshine State marked a new chapter in my life, where the coastal beauty and tropical climate captured my heart. My husband and I had been vacationing here in Florida for the past 30+ years. After selling our disaster restoration business in 2018, I still wanted to interact with the public and create lasting relationships, which led me to obtain my Real Estate license in Indiana and then in Florida. This enables me to seamlessly blend my Midwestern roots with my understanding of the nuances of the Florida real estate landscape. Whether it's helping clients find their dream homes in the heartland or facilitating smooth transactions in the sunny realms of Florida, my dual license empowers me to provide comprehensive and personalized service tailored to the specific needs of each client. The journey from the heartland to the Gulf Coast has not only broadened my horizons but has also allowed me to bridge two distinct worlds in the realm of real estate. With over three decades of entrepreneurship, owning and successfully managing a business for over 30 years has equipped me with a wealth of invaluable attributes. Throughout the years, I've honed my skills in negotiation, strategic planning, and a keen understanding of market dynamics. Moreover, my extensive business background has ingrained in me the importance of building lasting relationships, transparent communication, and an unyielding dedication to ethical practices. The longevity of my business venture reflects my ability to navigate through economic shifts and evolving industries. I am a breast cancer (triple negative) survivor since 2017. With almost a year of chemo, surgery, and radiation treatments, my resilience and faith was put to the test but also saw me through all my treatments and surgeries. When I have free time, I enjoy engaging in an array of hobbies, providing both relaxation and creative fulfillment. Crafting, gardening/canning, reading, trips to the beach, going new places and get togethers with friends creates a tapestry that enriches my life with creativity, tranquility, and the warmth of genuine friendships. My husband and I have 6 girls between us, as we are a blended family. We also share 9 grandchildren. We love to have them all over when schedules permit and enjoy catching up with their activities. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer, relocating to Florida, or looking to sell your current property, I am ready to guide you through the process. With my dedication to excellence and passion for real estate, you can trust me to turn your real estate goals into reality.",Pamela Doran,https://ap.rdcpix.com/a73c04f387f04e63611974c94bd843fea-e1028286271s.jpg,(727) 360-6927,(317) 710-1176

36,3209 W SMITH VALLEY RD STE 217-1 ,GREENWOOD,"As a lifelong Indianapolis resident, I am proud of our city and love to share it with others.  I grew up on the near southside, near Garfield Park where I cherish memories of little league baseball and sledding down the hills in the park.  On my 16th birthday, we moved to Franklin Township where I witnessed tremendous growth in that area.  My wife, Emily and I, were married at a young age and were lucky to purchase a small 2 bedroom home near the Greenwood Park Mall that we still own to this day.  We just couldn't let it go.  

After moving to Martinsville for a couple of years and having our first child, we returned to Greenwood.  We now have 2 boys that keep us on our toes, as well as give us a never-ending supply of laughter.   

I was in logistics management for about 15 years.  I was in that field because it paid for my college tuition as I worked my way through school.  While in college I married Emily and needed to provide so I kept doing what I knew, but it was never my passion.  Real estate had always interested me, but it was risky.  I was aware it was a competitive industry and many fail, but I finally took a leap of faith to do what I was passionate about and I am happy that I did.  I gain so much fulfillment being able to help my clients, many of whom are now friends, get the house of their dreams or walk away with more money than they realized they could.  I love houses and design but helping other people is my favorite part.  

When I can find the time, I like to do my own renovations to our home.  I also enjoy sports of all kinds (I play in a soccer league for us older guys once a week), I have coached my kid's basketball and baseball teams.  My wife and I enjoy exploring new restaurants and other hot spots in the city that seem to always be popping up.  We are lucky that we have one of the greatest races right here in our city that we love to attend each year.  I love sports cars and autocross regularly.

 I hope I have given you enough information about who I am, but if not, pick up the phone and give me a call.  I would be happy to buy you a drink and have a chat, and I'd be honored if you chose to work with me in any of your real estate needs.",Alan Hamson,https://ap.rdcpix.com/479265851/05a57c0d715cd5b5ad4e16e336a68de5a-e0s.jpg,(317) 496-0656

After many years with a traditional real estate company, Mike opened his own practice in Greenwood, Indiana. His dream was to have a Team Concept with a few professionals working together…not in competition with one another. He also wanted to add one special ingredient…fun! 

Over the past 25 years Mike Watkins Real Estate Group has been consistently ranked as one of the top real estate agents/teams in the Metropolitan Indianapolis area by the Indianapolis Business Journal. Due to its success, many other real estate firms have both emulated the Team Concept and shadowed the team in action to learn how it works.

The team concept, work ethic, and their experience, has continued to enable Mike Watkins Real Estate Group to stay successful regardless of the economic conditions. Much of that success comes from being geographic specific, meaning that they live, give back and work only on the Southside of Indianapolis and northern Johnson County. With the Team concept and selling homes in their own backyard, this has enabled them to help thousands of people buy, build or sell a home with the fewest possible hassles. 

It is true that over the years the Team has changed and evolved, but the one thing that Mike didn’t plan on happening was that his 2 sons, Pat and Chris, would want to be in the business with him. Pat is currently in his 25th year in real estate and Chris is in his 19th. In 2017, after forging his own path in the real estate industry for 39+ years, Mike decided to retire and sell the business to Pat and Chris. Today, they still continue to be one of the most successful real estate teams in the United States.",Patrick Watkins,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1cac0d25aacd732ec58826d0f9cb0731a-e861174954s.jpg,(317) 698-9566,(317) 882-6453

SWEET MESSAGE:
""To help people find that perfect home,"" Dody believes that everyone should have a home.  Whatever fits their budget and meets their criteria. Sometimes it's a 2-story five bedroom new construction home, some prefer single level older homes, while some are romanticized by the charm and character of older homes.  To each their own!  We love them all.

The process of working with our clients, joining them on the journey which fulfills their goals, making their dreams come true.  Sounds cliche' and reality is, a real estate transaction has several moving parts, each aspect must be managed.  We provide a plan of action for each client.

We call this journey an adventure ... the search for a home, like a scavenger hunt, looking through listings, going out on showings,  strategize, writing great offers, navigate inspections, responses, completing your loan application, reviewing appraisal, working through underwriting conditions, final walk-through, and finally, getting to that closing where you will sign your name on the dotted line of many legal documents and once the lender is satisfied all documents are properly executed you will be given a key along with your mortgage note and will leave the 'closing table' officially as a new home owner.

Whether it's your first time through the process, or you are an experienced homeowner, the process is the same.  Here in Indiana your real estate agent guides you through the transaction from start to finish.  We collaborate together with your lender and the title company working for you.


***We do reserve the right to work with terrific, wonderful, kind, overall great people!",Dody Mariscotti,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1850087073/01cd6a3d36aefc45ab5b94d3cd2390e2a-e0s.jpg,(317) 914-5557
57,Hilcrest Drive,Westfield,"Trent entered the real estate world as a landlord in high school. He purchased his first investment property, a hair salon, which showed cash flow from day one. Since then, Trent has enjoyed personally investing in single and multi-family properties, as well as coaching his clients through the real estate investment process. 

Trent studied economics at DePauw University and was active in the Management Fellows program and his fraternity, Sigma Chi. (The biggest win at DePauw was meeting his wife, Natalie, at freshman orientation!) The economic courses were foundational in Trent’s understanding of the market force, complexity of supply and demand, and statistics at the neighborhood level.

Since then, Trent spent 5 years as an account executive at the best marketing firm in Indianapolis, Element Three, where he guided clients on how to position their company to drive business. Trent’s largest client was a leader and innovator in the real estate space, which meant he had the opportunity to stay abreast of the cutting edge tools for Realtors. While Trent enjoyed crafting marketing strategies and helping clients reach their goals, he couldn’t ignore the pull to go full time into real estate.

Now Trent loves helping clients understand the market dynamics when buying and selling their homes. When he’s selling homes, Trent helps his clients craft a well thought-out pricing strategy and complimentary marketing plan to drive activity to the property and get it sold.

Trent truly loves putting together transactions and making sure clients are happy when the deal is complete. When asked, what can clients expect from him, Trent said,  “A very strategic approach! I’m a high-touch communicator and have drive to help you meet your goals quickly. You can expect at a minimum to talk weekly, if not more frequently. We will monitor and adjust our approach until we get an accepted offer.”",Trent Wood,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d5e9aaeabbd294a1a4321949f0b0b570a-e2845496447s.jpg,(317) 658-8323

I take great pride in the relationships I build and always work relentlessly on the client’s behalf to help them achieve their real estate goals. My philosophy is simple: Clients come first. I pledge to be in constant communication with my clients, keeping them fully informed throughout the entire buying or selling process.

52,301 Northfield Dr.,Brownsburg,"The real estate business is built on referrals, so for me, selling real estate is all about making connections with people and earning their trust and ultimately their business.  I do that by listening to my client’s needs, educating them on the buying or selling process, effectively pricing their home for what the market will bear, working tirelessly to market their home to the broadest buyer base possible, and supporting and advocating for them throughout the entire process.   
Very few decisions rival the importance of buying or selling a home and this can become a stressful and exciting time for the whole family.  Working with an agent you connect with, an agent with integrity, an agent who cares about you, an agent who understands the dynamics involved in a home sale or purchase, can put your mind at ease and be critical to smooth negotiations throughout the process.  Whatever your real estate needs or goals, I will give you the care and attention you deserve.
Your goals are my goals:   Get your house sold for the best possible price, under the most favorable terms, in the shortest time period, with the least inconvenience to you.",Lisa Hicks,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/afc411d00-c0o.jpg,(317) 289-1562

84,3405 East 86th Street,Indianapolis,"My career in sales began when I was just a boy.  I grew up in Meridian Kessler, and at the age of 9, I began selling the Indianapolis Star/News to our neighbors, and to families in the surrounding neighborhoods of Broad Ripple and Butler Tarkington.  I won trips to Washington D.C., New Orleans, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago for selling the most subscriptions, but I had no idea it was the beginning of my career in sales.  Back then, I was just excited to go on a trip without my parents!


In 1993, just two years after graduating from Indiana University in Bloomington, I began selling real estate with the F.C. Tucker Company, the largest real estate company in Indiana.  Since then, I have consistently been a top-producing agent and have been recognized as being in the Top 1% of All Indianapolis REALTORS®   High energy, uncompromising integrity, a positive attitude and savvy negotiating skills are the four key cornerstones to my success -- and to my happiness.  I am grateful to my loyal clientele, personal references and repeat business for allowing me to continue doing what I love!

And while I’m being grateful for what I love, thank you to Match.com for introducing me to my wife, Stephanie Franco Deemer.  We met in the summer of 2013, and had an instant connection!  We married in June of 2015, blended our families, and we all moved to a new home in Carmel, where her children attend school.  In 2016, after 23 years as a practicing attorney, Stephanie left her law practice and joined me at F.C. Tucker. Together we sell real estate as The “Deem” Team! 

No one will work harder for you than Stephanie and I will when it comes time to time to buy or sell your home. Combining our professional skills and strengths brings the best of both worlds together to provide unsurpassed experience, knowledge and attention to detail.  My focus has always been superior service.  That means listening. We listen to you, help you solve your problems, and find what you want, not what we think you should have.  That is why The “Deem” Team truly is your Indy Metro area Dream Team!

When I'm not selling houses, you can find Stephanie and me hanging out with (or driving around!) at least one of our five children: Adam, Kelsey, Ben, Marya and Andrew!  We enjoy entertaining family and friends and supporting our favorite local teams like the Indianapolis Colts, the Indiana Pacers and of course, the Indiana Hoosiers!

E-Flyers
 I maintain a complete list of the email address of every Realtor in the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors (MIBOR). When your house is first listed, or when an open house is scheduled, I send a full color brochure describing your property via an email (like the one you are currently viewing) to each agent.

Did you ever see me on TV as a Meteorologist?
No, because my wife and I have a heart for helping people!  Serving as a youth pastor and pastor for 23 years, we have moved 14 times to help people, congregations and communities of all kinds.  
During each move I’ve had good experiences and  bad. But one thing was consistent: MOVING WAS STRESSFUL! That is why I’ve started my career as a realtor!
Let me be Your Key to Indy!
I am confident that my love and knowledge of Indianapolis I have the skills and knowledge to implement the latest technology and techniques to help you find great success and reduce the stress involved with whatever real estate sales or purchases you are about to undertake in the area.

89,8700 NORTH ST STE 350,FISHERS,"7I consider myself an Illini, though I have lived in Indiana for more than half of my life. Born and raised in Southern Illinois, I grew up in very small communities, graduating with a class of 62 students. I think that has contributed to my outgoing personality, I never meet a stranger, because living in such small communities, you knew everyone. I was blessed to marry my wonderful husband of 37 years, after meeting him in college. He is a project manager at Technicolor. We have two great children, a daughter, Karissa, who is a Physician Assistant at Central Indiana Orthopedics and a son, Josh, who graduated from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University with a marketing degree and currently works as part of my team. They keep me busy but, I pride myself in always living a balanced life.

After working in the accounting field for several years, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to stay home and raise my children. After they were both in school full time, I needed to get back into the business world, so I took a part time job as an unlicensed assistant at Re/Max Ability Plus. I guess you could say real estate is in my blood; my mother is the broker/owner of Knox County Realty in Vincennes, Indiana. I received my real estate license in March of 1997 and continued at Re/Max as a licensed assistant. In August of 1997, I began my career with Century 21, when I accepted a position as a licensed assistant at Century 21 at the Crossing. As my business grew, I felt the need to further my career, when I was invited to become a member of The Richwine Real Estate Group at Century 21 Realty Group I.  Continued my journey with the Marchant Team at Keller Williams Indianapolis NE, moved on to be on my own at Century 21 Scheetz, where in 2014 I was the top agent for the whole company, not just my location.  I moved back to Keller Williams but knew something was missing.   I have now found the missing piece, I have joined Trueblood Real Estate where we can offer our clients superb multimedia to showcase their homes like no other.   I can’t wait to see where we can go!

I bring to my business a willingness to work hard but also the ability to keep my priorities in check. I look forward to creating more friendships and providing real estate service that I can be proud of. I have been a resident of Lawrence Township for 30 years and now live in Noblesville.  I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, whether it is slipping away to my “Happy Place”  or just relaxing at home! Creating friendships.. one home at a time.  Brought together by real estate, held together by friendship!",Kimberly Carpenter,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1798588342/9c8409549fc96dc3fec706d257c6cd45a-e0s.jpg,(317) 509-4000

18,135 E. Sycamore Street,Zionsville,"I have been a Realtor for Century 21 for almost 13 years and absolutely love the business and cant imagine doing anything else. It took me a while to get to this point and I would like to share that journey with you:I was born in Poland and came to the US with my family when I was 10 yrs old. I grew up in La Porte, Indiana, graduated from La Porte High School & then from IU with a BS in Finance. Logically, I worked as an Assistant Branch Manager at La Porte Bank & Trust for 3 years. Then decided to change careers and accepted a sales position with Xerox Corporation. It was something totally unlike me and it really made me step out of my comfort zone. I moved to Indianapolis and started a career selling office copiers, scanners and large engineering blue print copiers. I worked for Xerox Engineering Systems for 14 years and then for Oce Engineering Systems for 4 yrs. I had the same territory for 18 years, which included about 1/3 of Indiana. My customers were manufacturing companies & my goal was to understand their engineering process and how my product could help them simplify it. Customer Care was the main focus of my business as it was mostly repeat business. It was a good fit for me. I loved the job and therefore I did very well. I was very fortunate to have qualified for many Presidents Club trips and have been to a lot of beautiful places. I also invested in some real estate and at one point owned 4 homes on my own. Then I got married had 3 children and I decided to take a couple years off and stayed at home. After my youngest child went to kindergarten I decided to change careers again. My personal experience in real estate had a big influence on this decision. My parents taught me that real estate is always a great investment. They both worked in factories and spoke very little English at the time. Yet, they were able to send 3 kids through college flipping homes in the 70s & 80s. So, I decided to get my real estate license & start a new career. It just seemed to be another good fit for me. Over the last 35 years, I have lived in Noblesville, Fishers, Washington Township, Pike Township and currently reside on the West side of Carmel for the last 20 years. Time has gone by so fast. Next year I will have 3 kids in college: 2 at Purdue and 1 at IU. Outside of my family and work, I love get togethers with family & friends, playing euchre, gardening & cooking.",Anna Coats,http://ap.rdcpix.com/911b94f7df46ee457b7e2018f18707a1a-b2589807575s.jpg,(317) 873-1700,(317) 508-4252,(317) 873-1009

My decision to become a Realtor was not made lightly, but very carefully, as the tremendous responsibility it holds.  I consider it an honor and privilege representing people with their real estate needs, being their advocate and guiding them throughout the process.  Simply put, I treat every client with care, respect and professionalism and make myself available anytime of the day or night to answer a question or just to ease their minds.  A home is more than a place, it is a feeling of comfort, peace, tranquility, and provides us a profound sense of security and pride.

43,PO Box 520,Pendleton,"There is no one more committed to her clients than Shelly.

But, first and foremost, Shelly is a devoted parent. Shelly could not be more proud of each of her children! Shelly’s son, Brandon, is a fervent member of the United States Navy! Daughter Vanessa, at 17 years of age, graduated a year early from high school and is out there working hard as she decides her path. Her youngest, Kelsey, is still in high school and is leaning toward following in her big brother’s footsteps with a career in the military!

An accomplished business proprietor, Shelly Hughes is the owner of the Indy A-Team; Central Indiana’s primary choice for real estate.

Reliable, knowledgeable and dedicated are words you would use to describe the realtor you would choose as a partner and guide. These are attributes that clients boast about when describing Shelly Hughes.

However, there are two distinctive areas that have helped Shelly emerge from the crowd; remarkable client relationship growth and an exceptional emphasis on new build purchases.

One of the keys to being the realtor that people continue to turn to is building relationships that go beyond the business transaction…beyond the numbers, beyond the forms and legalities…Shelly understands that developing a relationship comparable to that of a trusted friend makes all the difference.

Of course, Shelly has the knowledge and expertise required to get the job done; but, Shelly stands apart from her colleagues because she supports clients long after the real estate deal has been successfully completed. Long after the ink has dried on the signatures, after boxes have been unpacked, dishes put away and welcome mats are placed on the door step, often in the form of an unexpected text, Shelly will be checking in to see how life is going for her clients. Undoubtably, this makes for an outstanding real estate business resulting in referrals and repeat clients; but more so, this displays character…integrity that you can count on for one of the biggest investments or moves in your life.

Why does she do it?

Yes, it’s good business! But Shelly truly gets joy from the spark in her clients’ eyes when she hands them the keys to that house that will become their home.

That’s exactly why she loves working with clients on new builds. Building a new home brings on hundreds of decisions and challenges that, quite honestly, might just seem like stressful hassles to some realtors. Not to mention the fact that working these deals could mean 7 or 8 months before agents receive compensation. But, for Shelly, there is no replacement for helping make a buyer’s dream come true!

Shelly is familiar with the issues that inevitably come with building a new home and is prepared to solve them without undue stress or cost for her buyers; invaluable skills! Shelly Hughes will be the first one to come to mind when you know someone in need of a realtor.

Not just your realtor but the professional that you will recommend to your friends and family.",Rachelle (Shelly) Hughes,https://ap.rdcpix.com/46116a70a9d52ac6c8d30cb90eb795aca-e361588368s.jpg,(317) 833-7718

12,,,"Real estate has always held a special place in Jaciâ€™s heart. Growing up in a blue collar family as a child of a hard working steelworker and small business owner, there was not much time nor resources for travel. However, she never felt deprived, because her parents always made sure their home was a special, warm place that welcomed everyone and made so many happy memoriesâ€¦a haven. Inspired by the sacrifice of her parents, Jaci attended Indiana University, where she earned degrees in Psychology and Business. She continued her education at the IU School of Law Indianapolis, where she received her Juris Doctor and met her husband, Grant. After practicing as an attorney for several years, Jaci made the difficult decision to stay home with their children. After multiple moves across the state, her family's journey led them back ""home"" to Indianapolis, where it all began. After planting their roots in the storybook town of Zionsville and as their children grew older, Jaci became incredibly eager to return to the workforce. The idea of being able to combine her contract knowledge and negotiating skills along with her passion for home design and helping others find their ""haven"" made real estate a natural choice. When Jaci met Traci, it seemed as though the stars even more perfectly aligned. Their similar upbringings, educational backgrounds, and desire to help others with their home quest made their partnership seem like a match made in heaven. Jaci and Traci strive to give their clients a real estate experience unlike one theyâ€™ve ever had before. Their sincere focus on relationship building and community are what make them a truly unique team.

44,7230 ARBUCKLE CMNS STE 148 ,BROWNSBURG,"Hello, my name is Lori Redman and I am your full-time, full service local realtor.  I began my real estate career in 2002 after a career as a nurse.  With my love for people and the community I spend time in, I quickly built a thriving real estate business.  I had always dreamed of opening my own real estate company and after a mixture of prayer, faith, long hours and hard work that dream became a reality in 2018, opening Sold It Realty Group.  Opening Sold It Realty Group has allowed me the opportunity to mix my love for people, philanthropy, and my real estate business all in one. 

As a professional realtor, I strive for excellence in customer satisfaction by providing top notch service for first-time home buyers and sellers, as well as excellent service to the most seasoned buyer and seller. Whether you’re interested in upsizing, downsizing or just interested in the real estate market, with my years of expertise, I will communicate, coordinate and participate in every area of the transaction. I will communicate details and be available to answer any questions you may have as they arise.

If you’ve dealt with other realtors in the past and had a negative experience or if you’ve never dealt with one before or if you’re just generally hesitant about what the experience might be like – allow me to assure you – I want you to feel comfortable with me, no matter what your expense range is or what your realty needs are. I sincerely want you to experience buying or selling in a way that will leave you with a positive, memorable experience. My goal is, that you become a “Raving Fan” of my real estate services so you will want to refer me to your family, friends, co-works, neighbors, etc.

I began my real estate career in 2002 working part-time as a realtor and as a nurse. By 2005 I knew this was my career for life and began my full-time journey as a realtor. I moved on from being a nurse but was still able to help others with a big life event, buying and selling their home. Once becoming a full-time realtor, I quickly received many awards as a top selling realtor in my area, as well as the prestigious “Hall of Fame” real estate award. The real reward however, is the opportunity to meet and help great clients who have become lifelong friends. 

On a personal note, I incorporate real estate in to my everyday life. I am fortunate that my husband also has his broker’s license so we are able work together. When we do have free time, our favorite activity is spending time with our children and grandchildren. We enjoy traveling, boating, and I love spending time with my horse. I have been blessed with a full rich life surrounded by those I love.

If you or someone you know has an interest in buying or selling – or even if you’re looking to make a career or company change — I encourage you to contact me! I am never too busy for you or ANY of your real estate referrals!!

Doing My Best for YOU!",Lori Redman,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1280441545/b52a1f527202598e5bfc7ddef5a7d95ea-c0s.jpg,(317) 370-9413

38,8310 Allison Pt Blvd,Indianapolis,"Mary Petruzzi’s clients are some of the happiest and most knowledgeable home buyers and sellers in Indianapolis today.
Since becoming a REALTOR® in 2003, her first priority when meeting a new client is to find out how she can best help them. Instead of just waiting for her turn to talk, she actively listens. The insight she gains helps her to more accurately address their wants and needs.
Next she gives them the information they need to move through the process of buying or selling a home with the least possible stress or uncertainty. Mary’s belief is that knowledge of today’s market leads to good decisions. When clients know what to expect at each step along the way, it makes the entire transaction more enjoyable for everyone.
A true “people person,” Mary’s favorite part of being a REALTOR® is the opportunity to become acquainted with so many interesting people and help them realize their goals. She respects the fact that this isn’t like any other purchase – unless you’re an investor, your home is where you live and raise your family.

As she helped them map their day's exploration, she realized that helping people get connected and find a good home base to walk or bike to work was a powerful way to build liveable communities.

Her passion for life at human scale began during her tenure in Los Angeles as her husband completed medical school. Finding LA to be a disjointed city that left people isolated and frustrated by hours in their cars, she returned to her hometown of Bloomington and started working at the Bike Project and served on the Mayor's Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Commission. She and her husband matched in Indianapolis for a Med-Peds residency, and they bought their first home in Ransom Place, a short walk from all five of the hospitals where he would serve. Although they outgrew their house faster than expected when they had twins, the couple moved a block over to stay in their neighborhood and can be found biking around the city with their daughters and sometimes their dog.

I began in a small, family-owned real estate and Executive Property Management Company and eventually grew to be the Vice President of the company. In my 10 years with the company I helped people find homes for lease, international relocation, management of a team and residential real estate sales. In 2009 I relocated to Southern Indiana and began with Keller Williams Realty Louisville East. In 2010, I helped 31 families find their new home simply by responding to Internet emails. Now with United Real Estate and loving the real estate market, I formed Your Journey Team in 2011 because I truly believe it's our clients ""Journey"" to sell and find a new home. Please give me a call anytime on my cell phone or email me directly and let me know how I can help you on your journey!!",Niki Fuller,https://ap.rdcpix.com/366150750/79dc61c00d86e3a1e8364a413b94d84ea-e0s.jpg,(502) 523-5554,(317) 216-8800

Great buying opportunities and low interest rates make this an excellent time to realize the dream of that special home.  Navigating turbulent waters and providing value to my clients is my passion, and I have a unique skill set to accomplish just that.

I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelors of Science degree in Building Construction Management Technology and Engineering, with additional specializations in Mechanical and Electrical construction.  Following graduation, I worked as a Project Engineer with a local construction engineering firm, using my training to complete multiple high profile heavy industrial projects.  While earning my degree, I worked in custom residential construction, learning what to look for in a trouble-free, well-constructed home.  So why is this important to you as a buyer or seller?  Instead of hoping for a good result in the biggest financial decision of your life, you will have the critical eye of a trained professional evaluating your purchase and representing your sale.  Most realtors can pull comps, discuss interest rates, etc.  But can they look at foundation integrity, thermal efficiency, load dynamics and all the other factors that make a good home great, then help you make an informed decision?  I can.

I became a Professional Realtor to bring real value to clients at a vulnerable point in their lives.  I am committed to our mutual success in every single transaction, and look at lifelong relationships as the true measure of my success.

My goal as a Real Estate Agent is to make your experience a memorable one (in a GOOD way!) from start to finish. I am committed to taking that extra step in helping my clients move forward in finding their forever home. What makes me unique is that I have been a business owner in the moving industry for over 20 years. My husband, Tim, and I are owners of a small local business named Kohnen's 3rd Party Service, INC. We service Indianapolis and surrounding areas. My experience has made me familiar with the front end and back end of the total process. I have several affiliations, including the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors (MIBOR). I also have my staging designation. With these relationships, along with my relationships with lenders and builders, I can help you in the buying and selling process. I moved from Ohio over 20 years ago with my husband, Tim.

14,845 S GULFVIEW BLVD UNIT 110,CLEARWATER BEACH,"Serving Florida & Indiana

I have been a Real Estate Broker since 2001 and in the real estate services business and  since 1985 working in all areas of the construction industry.

We currently service multiple markets such as Central Florida and throughout Indiana.
We buy, sell and manage Short Term Rentals, Long Term Rentals and Single-family homes across Central Florida and the Gulf Coast. 

We have been in the Indianapolis market for many successful years and will be here for many more!

Our property management division is a Top Producer in buying, selling and managing Short Term Rentals (STRs). Our 5-star ratings and super host status with platforms like Airbnb show our commitment to service in the Hospitality Industry. We can help with projecting income numbers for investments as well as demonstrating how a property will perform to getting it sold at maximum value. 

This longevity and confidence come from my real estate services to a great many Buyers and Sellers and their recommendations to others that result in repeat and referral business that keeps me productive and successful.

As a full service real estate professional, I work with Buyers, Sellers and Investors in real estate transactions spanning all of the price ranges and property types but most important our service does not stop when the transaction closes! Read my reviews and you will see that you can truly count on us to be there when you have real estate questions even after you buy the home.
 
Residential Single Family – My residential single-family services connect Buyers with Sellers every day and I do it with professionalism and a total dedication to my clients. This property type is the majority of my market transactions, but by far not the only one in which I have expertise.

Condominiums – While condominiums are residential, they’re a very different market focus and I am an expert in evaluating Condos and helping Buyers and Sellers to cope with the special financing and homeowner concerns for this property type.

Multi–family – Investors are great clients for me. We purchase dozens of properties every year from Foreclosure auctions and Banks. We have developed a very good system for these properties much more real life than things you will find on HDTV!

Multi–family properties are a very unique market. The detailed return on investment and valuation calculations investors need to evaluate properties for rental are second nature to me.

Commercial – Whether it’s a shopping mall, a small office building or a restaurant space, I'm your commercial property specialist. Contact me for your commercial property needs and if it is not something we are versed in, we will put you in contact with the right person for the job.

Vacant Land – Land is a very special property class. It’s relatively easy to show a gourmet cook a wonderful commercial kitchen in a home and see their eyes light up. It’s more of a challenge to help a Buyer or Seller to realize the potential in a piece of land. A substantial amount of our sales each year come from New Construction. We have great personal relationships with a large number of builders all over Indiana and Florida that helps us to determine which builder would suit your needs and find the right fit for you.

0,230 E 16TH ST,INDIANAPOLIS,"Anna was born and raised in Columbus, Indiana. Growing up on a lake near her family farm, it only makes sense that Anna has a soft spot for waterfront properties and homes in the country. She is a small-town girl at heart, but loves living in the Circle City and all that it has to offer! 

Anna's passion for real estate is in her DNA. Her father, owning his own plumbing and heating business for over 35 years, while simultaneously building homes and rental properties has set the tone for Anna's real estate career. Anna saw firsthand how his vision and hard work combined to create beautiful, functional spaces and appreciates the importance of real estate as an investment.

A graduate of the University of Indianapolis (Go Greyhounds!), Anna holds degrees in both Psychology and Occupational Therapy and worked as an Occupational Therapist (OT) for 10 years. As an OT working in hospitals, Anna partnered with her clients to regain their independence, in the hardest of circumstances. She has a passion for helping others, an unwavering work ethic, and an unmatched ability to help her clients achieve their goals. She now utilizes her OT skill set to not only help her clients find homes, but to also find the best home to suit their needs, be it for aging in place, accommodating a disability, or making space for a growing family. 

Anna loves traveling, living as far away as Athens, Greece, but found that all roads lead back home to Indiana. Anna and her husband purchased their first home north of downtown in Fall Creek Place in 2019. Since then, they have added two beautiful children to their family. You can find them at Colts games, local eateries and breweries, and enjoying the local music scene. They also love any chance to get outdoors, especially next to the water!

Anna's approach as a real estate professional, is to establish a true partnership with her clients. Whether the goal is to purchase a first home, relocate, find an investment property, expand or downsize, Anna understands that every client is unique and requires an individualized strategy tailored to them. She takes the time to get to know her clients and their needs to truly personalize her clients' experience. Anna's dedication combined with her exceptional organization and problem solving skills lead to stress-free, smooth transactions for her clients.

In her five years of real estate experience, her business has always centered around her clients needs — helping beyond the closing table and creating long-lasting relationships. 

Prior to real estate, Anna was a caregiver, working with the disabled and eldery. You would say it is in her nature to help people. Anna also has a musical background, being a Soprano II for the Indianapolis Symphonic Choir, and previously a vocalist and fiddler for a Klezmer band that toured the west coast. Fun note... she sang at Carnegie Hall in October 2016! 

Anna holds a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. She is originally from the Washington DC area, and currently lives in the Meridian-Kessler area with her three dogs: Keeper, Scout, and Buddy.  She loves the look and feel of historic architecture, (and even the complications!), as well as the history of the older Indy homes! 

Aside from real estate, Anna enjoys swing dancing locally and throughout the Midwest, as well as participating in cycling events, and spending time in the outdoors. 

Whether finding the perfect home or marketing yours with top notch photography, out of the box strategies, and brilliant staging, Anna is here to become your personal real estate counselor and detective.

37,8313 W 10th Street,Indianapolis,"Hi, I'm René, a successful full-service realtor for RE/MAX, living in Plainfield, Indiana, on the west side of Indianapolis. I stand out from all of the other Realtors in the area with my relentless work ethic, passion, dedication, communication and positive energy. I specialize in helping clients upsize, downsize and relocate. I'm also a mentor for new agents; wife to my husband, Joel; a mom to our two teenagers, Gabrielle & Jonathan; as well as our lovable Goldendoodles, Fozzie and Zoe. Our family enjoys spending time in the backyard, skiing in the winter (and I love to snowboard), attending soccer games, and participating in various activities around the Indianapolis area. If I'm not on the road for work, I'm usually working in my home office with either a cup of coffee or hot tea depending on the time of day. 

A word I would use to define myself is Passionate! I'm passionate about negotiating, understanding market value, solving problems & implementing systems and processes so my transactions run smoothly. I have a passion for learning new technology which allows me to be creative with marketing my listings. Most of all, I'm passionate about helping my clients and guiding them throughout the entire real estate transaction. My goal is to earn your trust, and be your realtor for life!

Communication, is pivotal to negotiations and keeping everything on track for closing. I am a firm believer of the saying, ""Where there is a will there is a way!” I work hard keeping my transactions moving forward, and I’m determined to figure out solutions when obstacles arise. Within the real estate world no two transactions, clients or agent (who represents the other party) are alike. This is an industry where you have to be able to adapt to different personalities to negotiate and manage the transaction. Again, excellent communication is critical for a smooth and successful real estate closing. 

Sometimes, real estate transactions are emotional experiences. It's ok, and please trust me when I say, ""I will do my best to help you navigate the emotions despite the circumstances.” Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of working with wonderful clients who were going through a divorce, the loss of a family member, downsizing, health issues, or relocation. These are sensitive situations which may trigger an array of emotions. I will be your advocate as you move forward so you have a positive real estate experience with minimal stress.

I'm devoted to my career in real estate, and there is nothing I love more than the friendships that have formed and the hugs and ""Thank You's"" that I have received at the closing table. I look forward to hearing from you, and discussing how I can represent you with your real estate needs.

I would encourage you to read my client reviews on Google, Zillow and Facebook. You will not be disappointed! – René Hauck

40,48 N Emerson Ave Suite 300,GREENWOOD,"Hello There and thank you so much for visiting our site. My name is Shawna Brooks  and I am the owner of Shawna’s Home Team at Keller Williams Realty in Greenwood, Indiana.
My husband Jason and I are both licensed Realtors and we both specialize in Real Estate in Greenwood, Indiana. Jason focuses primarily on helping to find Homes for Sale in Greenwood and Center Grove for First Time Buyers, Move Up Buyers and others wanting to Downsize in the Greenwood or Center Grove area.
What our team is probably best known for is our GUARANTEED SALE PROGRAM……simply because there’s nothing else like it being offered anywhere. In a nut shell, we basically sit down with a potential seller, take a look at their home, and then put a number in writing that we will guarantee to sell their home for within the first 120 days of our listing contract. I have been offering this program for a little over nine years now and am pleased to say I’ve only lost on it once…..right Sara Coe?
I have lived in the Greenwood area for the last 16 years. We go to church at Emmanuel Church of Greenwood; our nephew, Jesse, that lives with us played football and graduated from Center Grove High School; our Keller Williams office is located in Center Grove, near the intersection of State Road 135 and Fry Rd and we are intimately familiar with the Greenwood / Center Grove area.
When we aren’t selling real estate in Greenwood, we can usually be found laughing and enjoying life with our favorite kids on the planet….. Jesse, Kennedie and Peyton and our two needy but lovable Yorkie mixes…. Sadie and Sophie. We love hanging out with our friends, playing music around the fire pit in our backyard, relaxing at Mallow Run when the whether cooperates and without a doubt, our most frequented restaurant is Margarita’s (our favorite is the one located near US 31 and Stop 11…..just north of PetSmart).
Jason went to Ball State and was a CNC Machinist for 17 years before getting his real estate license. I am a graduate of Taylor University with a degree in Music Education and taught elementary music for five years before entering this whacky world of real estate 16 years ago. (And by the way….if you have any doubt about whether we know anything about online marketing…… Jason and I actually met online!! So yes….we know a thing or two about marketing online!!). LOL
If you know of anyone needing to buy or sell a home anywhere in the Greenwood, Center Grove or Indianapolis area, please have them get in touch with us at 317.294.1861. We are serious about representing the best interests of our clients and look forward to making lifelong relationships that last beyond the closing table.
Thank you again for taking the time to visit our site. We look forward to the chance to meeting you in person soon!!

122,230 E 16TH ST,INDIANAPOLIS,"I entered real estate wanting to help young people navigate a process that seemed foreign and overwhelming to them. I wanted to be a partner that helped guide them based on their specific goals and what was right for their wants and needs; not a salesperson only worried about the end result. I am honored to have assisted 100+ buyers and sellers in the Metro Indy area thus far in my career. I can attribute this success to my disciplined, charismatic and creative approach to problem-solving and an overall passion for serving others.

I moved to Indiana from the Philadelphia area to play field hockey at IU (Go Hoosiers!), and chose to stay in Indianapolis because I loved the young, positive energy and potential for growth that Indy exhibited. This city continues to inspire me, and I can’t imagine living anywhere else! Prior to entering real estate in 2017, I served as a Director with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis at both the Fountain Square and Martindale-Brightwood locations. I continue to support youth work here in Indianapolis through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis and Playworks Indiana.  

I currently reside in Historic Irvington with my wife, daughters and dog, Walter the Weimaraner.

4,438 S EMERSON AVE # 147,GREENWOOD,"As an agent who's an expert in this local area, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise about buying and selling real estate here. Real estate is not the same everywhere, so you need someone you can trust for up-to-date information. I am here to serve you and all of your real estate needs. 

Here are some of the things I can do for you:

Find Your Next Home
You need someone who knows this area inside and out! I can work with you to find the right home at the right price for you, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home

Sell a Home
When it's time to move, you need someone who will advertise your home, show to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, arrange financing, oversee the inspections, handle all necessary paperwork and supervise the closing. I can take care of everything you need, from start to close.

Consult on Home Selling Tactics
Oftentimes buyers don't visualize living in your home the way you do. I can make your home attractive to its ideal audience - which can help you get top dollar. Things like staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls can be the difference between a home resting on the market and one that's sold fast.",Angela Walker,http://p.rdcpix.com/v04/a8b462000-c0l.jpg,(317) 557-0771

Prior to becoming a Realtor, I had been an entrepreneur my entire life. I started an online sales business with my own website/eBay/Amazon in 2000 when I was 16 years old in High School. The business grew tremendously with nearly 500 different products to manage/ship and millions of dollars in sales over the years. In 2011 I acquired my first rental property to start investing in Real Estate. I spent a lot of time studying the in’s and out’s of investing over several years, and in 2016 I purchased my first “flip house” and I was hooked. Since then I have rehabbed many homes in Hendricks, Marion, and Putnam Counties. I sold off my online business in 2017 to focus on it full time. Naturally, the next move was to acquire my Real Estate license in order to help others and complement my existing investment business.

I have experience in: Representing Buyers and Sellers, Investment, Property Management, Rentals, Commercial Leasing, Sheriff Sales, Tax Sales and Rehabbing Ugly Houses. 

That’s enough about me, feel free to reach out to me today, I would love to help you with your Real Estate goals.

I’ve often been asked if I “specialize” in a certain part of the City.  My answer is always YES.

I specialize in the Metropolitan Indianapolis Area.  What does that mean exactly?  That means that whether you are looking to buy or sell a home in the Indianapolis area and all surrounding counties, I can help you!  I know the city like the back of my hand. I am always keeping up to date with what is going on in the market place and definitely pass that knowledge and information to my clients.

I am a graduate of Butler University with a degree in Accounting.  During my senior year internship in the accounting arena I realized the accounting world wasn’t the right fit for me.  I needed to be out with people, serving people, interacting face to face with people each and every day.  After a short time in the Radio Promotions and Marketing field I found myself continually being drawn to Real Estate.  Upon pursuing the Real Estate industry I immediately knew that helping people buy and sell homes was the perfect career fit for me.  Being able to help people make one of the biggest decisions of their lives is not something I take lightly.  I pride myself in being a great listener.  I listen to what my client’s needs and wants are, and then I help direct them to fulfill their real estate goals. 

One of the reasons I have been successful in my Real Estate career is because of the referrals that my past clients entrust to me.  Customer Service Excellence is the most important part of my business. My past clients are confident that the service they receive is the same quality service I provide to their friends and family!  The most prestigious award provided in the CENTURY 21 Company is that of the Quality Service Award.  I am happy to say that each year since starting my career I have received this honor.

16,643 Massachusetts Ave.,Indianapolis,"I am passionate about placemaking, and believe wholeheartedly that homes are the creative launchpad to what brings us the most joy and makes us the most powerful in our lives. Whether it be your passion for cooking delicious meals for your family, writing short stories, or crunching numbers, finding a home that can support you in the day-in and day-out of getting in your flow and achieving your dreams is what is most exciting to me about being a realtor. And the process of buying and selling a home? Well, it should be hassle-free, informative, and fun. I started my journey in real estate when I became a homeowner at the age of 23, and Iâ€™ve lived in the same home for nearly 20 years. Homeownership has been a steady and exciting journey of building equity toward my familyâ€™s financial freedom, and my home is an external reflection of who I am. In this home, I raised a family, found rejuvenation and solace; and within these walls, I composed 5 full-length albums of original music with my band, Sarah Grain & the Billions of Stars. My home was and continues to be my springboard to a rich and fulfilling life. From very early on, I knew that the improvement of neighborhoods and communities was going to be my north star. Born and raised in Indianapolis, I attended North Central High School, and at Indiana University I created my own major in Urban Studies and Community Development. I was fascinated by cities and wanted to work in a field where I could help people develop a strong sense of place within their physical environment, as well as strong bonds with their neighbors. After graduation, I began my career at Keep Indianapolis Beautiful (KIB), where I stayed for 8 years and worked as Director of Community Engagement and Volunteers, growing the volunteer-led Adopt-A-Block program by hundreds of volunteers, and partnering with communities across the city to increase their neighborhoodâ€™s tree canopy through KIBâ€™s NeighborWoods program. My years at KIB were paramount to my profession as a realtor, though I didnâ€™t know it at the time. Being in charge of neighbor-based volunteer programs around the city brought me into every zip code of Indianapolis, every neighborhood, and offered me an insider view to what contributes to neighborhood change over time, and what brings long-term value to a community. It matters to me to listen deeply to what is most important to my clients and when they have concerns, big or small, I investigate and problem-solve regularly so they feel seen, heard, and informed every step of the way. I look forward to learning more about what you wish to do with this one â€œwild and precious lifeâ€� ... and how I can help make buying or selling your home serve you in this purpose! Letâ€™s launch you into your best life!",Sarah Grain,https://ap.rdcpix.com/9bb7b7aa77af33405a991f548c91acd3a-c146767589s.jpg,(317) 814-5500,(317) 726-9372

6,6101 N. College Ave.,Indianapolis,"After spending 30 years in the insurance industry, I decided to start a real estate career where I could be in control of my own destiny.  I've not once looked back and yearned for the days of corporate life.  It was good to me and I had many good opportunities and experiences.  But, there is nothing quite as rewarding for me than to be in a position of helping buyers and sellers realize their dreams of home ownership.  The knowledge I've gained over the years about our local markets, our communities, our schools, the services provided by them, the types and quality of construcion to name a few have prepared me to be able to aptly consult with my clients to ensure their needs will be met.  Locating the right area and the ideal home is the exciting part of the transaction, but that is just the beginning.  Working through the offer/counter offer process, arranging financing and negotiating inspection findings can often result in highly charged emotions putting the transaction in jeopardy.  This is where the REALTOR really earns their due and can demonstrate their negotiating skills. I feel the knowledge I've gained over the years and the continuing education in earning several prestigious designations give me a competitive edge in representing my clients.  There is an old adage, ""the devil is in the details"" and it certainly is important in preparing contracts, negotiating terms and price, being aware of the market conditions, and being proficient in use of the Internet and other media in marketing homes.  I pride myself on being just such a detail oriented person utilizing proven systems to keep things from ""falling through the cracks"" so that contractual obligations are met by my clients.

SELLING A HOME? The first step is an in-home consultation where I learn your goals in the sale of your home and take a tour.

I always include a staging consultation and professional photography for my listings, so that we highlight all the beauty of your home appropriately. Your home will be promoted in several outlets beyond the MLS, including pay per click advertising and several social media channels. I always hold open houses with custom information packets that showcase not just the unique selling points of your home but also incorporate information on the school system, nearby attractions, the neighborhood and the community. Bottom line, I will help you maximize your sales price and other offer terms, so that you capitalize on your investment.

A “Chip” from Central Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science in marketing and business, she was very involved in leadership and a proud member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority. 

After moving to Indianapolis nearly 15 years ago, she gained contract and negotiation experience working in a law office dealing with client credit issues. Coupled with her studies and innate desire to help people, this all set the stage for a natural transition to real estate. And Minna loves what she does. Her clients rave about her informed, confident manner and her attention to detail.  

She’s a lover of the arts, spending several years as a member of the Indianapolis Symphonic Choir, while also enjoying bike rides with her husband and son through downtown, home decorating, and singing & dancing wildly in her car to a great song (never a moment in life without music!). She’s also a big sports fan and loves nothing more than getting people together for good food and a great game! 

After having lived in several areas of the city including the heart of Mass Ave, Irvington, and the Old Northside, since 2016 she is loving life in Bates-Hendricks with her husband Cory, son Smith, and their pug Walter.

30,1270 MACLAREN CT.,FRANKLIN,"Buying and selling real estate is quite possibly the most important and exciting decision you will ever make. Choosing a qualified and helpful Realtor will eliminate any anxiety or uncertainty you may have.  Let me introduce myself.  My name is Mitzi Christian and residential and commercial real estate is my passion. I am dedicated to assisting you, step by step and question by question.  I thoroughly enjoy taking my clients from “just looking” to “moving day” and answering all of their questions along the way. 

But don’t take my word for it…all Realtors say that!

Interview several Real Estate Agents before choosing the one who is right for YOU! 
-Do they listen and are they open to suggestions from you?
-Do they explain the process along the way in easily understood terms?
-Do they answer your questions or avoid them?
-Do they follow through with what they say?
-Do you feel they really care about your best interest and not their own paycheck?
-Do they show up on time?
-Do they return your calls?
-If you’re selling: Do they use multiple marketing tools in order to properly market your home?
-If you’re buying: Are they showing you homes that meet your criteria?

The “FIRE ME!” Guarantee: No one likes to be locked into a business relationship with no way out. At   Modern Realty, if we are not performing to your expectations or delivering on what we have promised, we offer an open ended contract which you may terminate at any time.",Mitzi Christian,https://ap.rdcpix.com/07a3ce6f6d83a12e7cb0b022e9daeb90a-e152552042s.jpg,(317) 439-4343
16,1425 E 86TH ST STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"I am a caring, creative and conscientious Realtor whose job is to protect you during every step of your real estate transaction. I take this role seriously and always work in your best interests. 

I listen closely to understand your wants, needs and concerns, your budget, timeframe, and more. I want to learn what’s truly important to you in a home – a particular setting, architectural style, or neighborhood amenities, for example. 

Whether you’re buying, selling or building new, I will carefully listen and follow through on every commitment until you’re happy and satisfied. I  also strive to make the process pleasant, painless and positive.

I recently became a Certified New Home Specialist and Residential Construction Consultant. In these roles, I can help you find the best builder, lot, community, and help you make the best decisions regarding fixtures and finishes that you will love, but that will also stand the test of time, especially at resale time.  

I am also a Seniors Real Estate Specialist (SRES) who helps those who are ""right-sizing"" their homes, moving to be closer to children and grandchildren, retiring out of state or making the transition to an active adult community, assisted living facility or nursing home. I know these moves can be difficult, as you may be saying goodbye to a neighborhood you've lived in for a long time. I am sensitive to this and work hard to help make the transition a positive one.  

Finally, I am also a Certified Probate Real Estate Specialist, who can help if you plan to sell a home that belonged to a loved one. I work with a stable of professionals, and can recommend those who can help with decluttering, packing, moving items, and managing an estate sale, for example. I want to be your ""one-stop shop"" for all you might need at this time.  

In addition, I attend ongoing real estate classes to keep my knowledge and expertise current and fresh, and I always keep the Realtor Code of Ethics front and center on my desk.

I spent 23 years as a public school teacher, and the last 7 of those years overlapped with real estate.

Just like in the classroom, I strive to understand each client's needs, so that I can guide them through the process, helping to solve problems along the way.

Paul’s career in Real Estate began in 2006 with a Property Management company in California. After mastering the leg work (open houses, showings, etc.), he realized how much he really enjoys helping others fulfill their housing goals. In 2008, he relocated back to Indiana and got his Real Estate License.

Since then, he has grown a solid foundation in Indianapolis and currently working with Buyers, Sellers and Investors. His main goal is to make your buying/selling process simple and stress-free. Paul is the Managing Broker of the Best Life Realty Group!

What makes Paul different from most agents is that Paul takes a non salesy approach to real estate. He is more focused on building a strong relationship with you and putting your needs first vs how many houses he can sell this year.

When Paul isn’t working, he enjoys “Living his best life”. He has coached his kids in baseball since tee-ball and enjoys that time on the field with them. The beach is where you will find him during vacay. He also is a Pizza lover and will never turn down a slice.

Whether you have been through the buying and selling process before or not, it can be stressful at times, and I understand that. My job is to help you find the fun and excitement that comes with this new chapter in your life. I am here to help you take that next step. I understand that this process is all about you and what you want or
need for yourself, your family, your pet (s), and/or any other factors that
have a direct correlation with the decisions you make.

For my sellers, I am very thorough in preparing your home to list. I assist colleagues within my brokerage and others with prepping their listings as a staging consult through my design business. As a part of my service to you, I will bring in décor items
(rugs, art, greenery, bedding, etc.) from my inventory, if needed, to aide in
enhancing the photography and showing potential. This is just one of many
things I do for my clients. For my buyers, I can assist with finding you a home
that is completely turnkey, one that requires a little work, or a lot of work.
Going a step further, I offer services to help with minor updates for your new
home and/or do some larger renovations. I am also familiar with designing new
construction and can assist in guiding you through each step throughout the
process whether it is a custom build or production. I enjoy working with
investors as well.

I have extensive business management experience with a Bachelor’s in Applied Business Management earned through Tri-State University. I also earned a diploma from the Interior Design Institute and started my own interior design business, Kristin Ann Interior Design. I have always had an admiration for creating and reinventing
spaces. I have the ability to see potential, even when my clients cannot. Even
if the home checks every wish list, you will want to personalize it in some
way. I am capable of not only assisting my clients with the business and
financial aspect of buying and/or selling, but I also am able to offer an
artistic aspect with my creative background. Marrying real estate
with my education and experience was the final piece of my accomplishments set
forth to achieve. I have a strong passion for residential real estate and
believe that my approach to service my clients matches very well with the
culture of my brokerage.

79,1533 Olive Branch Parke Lane Suite A,Greenwood,"In 2020 I jumped in the Indy real estate scene with a passion for walking alongside people as they find the home that will house the next season of their lives. Real estate in Indianapolis felt dead - like it was filled with the same tasks and strategies it had been for the last 50 years. I saw the opportunity to give Indy real estate a refresh in service, strategy, marketing, and knowledge, so The Patterson Collective was born. As an enneagram 4, wing 3, I have a strong sense to hustle and achieve, but at my core Iâ€™m a sensitive, lover of people who sees the beauty in all. That does not stop short of real estate. I believe that every home has a story and holds the memories of each family that has lived in it and will support each new family for seasons to come. It's an honor for me to walk alongside clients as they find where they will spend the next season of their life. I will dive deep into the lifestyle your home needs to accompany, ask the hard questions, and refuse to let you settle. I will walk with you through the frustrations and the joys and make it fun and light-hearted every step of the way.",Rachel Patterson,https://ap.rdcpix.com/278a3f119794e00031fd0ef884dfc990a-e3457813473s.jpg,(317) 881-2100,(317) 544-8600

1,12710 Meeting House Road Suite 100,Carmel,"Prior to joining Sothebyâ€™s International Realty team, Spencer Kline had been affiliated with one of Indianaâ€™s top real estate companies for almost ten years. In his first year as a Realtor, he was awarded as one of the top five rookies, and he has continued to build upon his success in the business. Spencerâ€™s ultimate goal is to provide the highest possible level of service to his clients. His top priority is ensuring a smooth, stress free transaction. This is achieved utilizing his extensive real estate expertise, his incredible attention to detail, and his well-honed sales and communication skills. Spencer is a graduate of Northwestern University where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and is a member of the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors, the National Association of Realtors, and the Indianapolis Association of Realtors. As a professional, as well as a person of high integrity, it is no wonder that over 98% of his business is done by referral from his past clients. As a twenty year resident of Carmel, Spencer is always up to date on all the happenings around town, but he focuses his business in areas from downtown up through the northern suburbs and all areas in between. As a Sothebyâ€™s International Realty Broker Associate, he believes that although Sothebyâ€™s International Realty is the premier luxury real estate brokerage with a reputation for marketing and selling high end properties, it is not a price range, but a level of service. Providing platinum service is a top priority. As a buyerâ€™s agent, Spencer will put in the extra time and effort to find the â€œrightâ€� home for his clients. He also specializes in helping and protecting his first time home buyers. As a listing agent, his strategy is to make each property he lists the jewel of whatever price range it falls in. Not all homes are million dollar listings. Spencer, however, believes that all homes should be marketed as if they are. This mentality gets his listings sold quickly and profitably. Although his work and career is of great importance, Spencer enjoys many activities outside of the work arena. He is the past president of the menâ€™s club at his synagogue and is very involved in community affairs. Spencer also served on the Indiana University Parentâ€™s Board and was involved with recruiting and alumni relations. Additionally, he serves as executor for the Amy Kline Memorial Scholarship Fund, in memory of his late wife, which offers financial scholarship support to graduating Carmel High School seniors. Most importantly, he is the proud father of two daughters, Haley and Lindsay. Haley graduated from Indiana University is now working for Travelers Insurance Corporate. Lindsay is now living in Manhattan buying Calvin Klein for Macyâ€™s Corporate after graduating in the top 1% of her IU Kelly School of Business class. Spencer can be found attending sporting and social events, enjoying the local restaurants and theater, and spending time with friends.",Spencer Kline,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/a1cd51500-c0o.jpg,(317) 660-4444,(317) 660-4444

In addition to being a GRI Broker Associate and being named Sales and Listing Leader of the year with  her former company for several consecutive years, Dianna has achieved something that many others in the business tend to overlook.

 “I love to help people achieve their goals,” said Dianna. “I am sensitive to each situation that my clients may be facing. Some clients are going through a divorce that forces them to move, while others need an expansion because of a growing family. Some need downsizing because of a job loss or an empty nest. I am attentive to and care about their individual situation.”

Curb Appeal Realty offers several helpful tools such as mainstream media advertising, virtual home tours and web exposure on several local and national websites. Dianna utilizes all of these resources in her business and also holds open houses as well as spends personal time searching for and showing homes to her clients.

34,5688 E 700 N,WILKINSON,"Real Estate is a relationship business for me. I enjoy working with buyers and sellers of all ages and price ranges. From first time home buyers to the rightsizing individuals looking to cater to their needs at that moment. Whether it's to sell everything and travel the world, or downsize to fit their current needs so that they can golf more! 

All of my clients come to me as repeat and referrals and I love it. I am now selling homes to the kids of my clients from 20 years ago.  The relationships and friendships that I have built over my career fulfill me and continue to drive me to help more people. 

I enjoy working with fellow Realtors to help strengthen our community and to network as a resource for each other. Recently, I represented District 2 as a Director on the Board of Directors serving Hancock, Madison, Shelby, Decatur and Eastern Marion County. Since 2008 I have sat and currently sit on various committees at the board. For the last four years I have been on the board for the Hancock County Division and the Chair the last two. Currently, I am serving on the Grievance Board and as the Chair for the Hancock County Division of MIBOR. 

I was blessed and honored to receive the 2023 Realtor of the Year award for both our local division and the MIBOR service area covering 12 counties in January.  My passion is educating and serving the buyers, sellers, fellow Realtors and our community. Giving back is what I am lead to do.  ""It's not what you have, it's what you do with what you have."" 

I have been married for 24 years to Tim and we have two amazing boys Wyatt and Cash. We also have 3 pretty awesome dogs, 7 horses, a mule, a mini and a donkey named Buddy. We live on a horse farm in eastern Hancock County. My boys have been unofficially working in real estate with me every step of the way from helping host open houses, install signs, retrieve lockboxes and help wherever they can. 

We own and operate Tim Looper Heating and Cooling, LLC which both of our boys work for. We all love to travel, ride, camp, spend time with our family, attend church and give back to our community. It's a family affair.

She received her Bachelors of Arts in Psychology from Purdue University and her Masters of Education from Indiana University specializing in Educational Counseling. LaToya is happily married and have 2 beautiful daughters. Mrs. Dix has many years of experience in education and psycho-educational counseling. She has had the pleasure of working in the public and private school sector. 

One of LaToya's favorite quotes is “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” – Eleanor Roosevelt

2014 was the year that LaToya stepped out on Faith to begin the beauty of her dreams by starting a new career in Real Estate. Many have asked the how and why questions. It’s been a dream of hers for many years. In her mid-twenties, Mrs. Dix dreamed of owning a home and honestly had no idea what to do but knew it was the best thing to do instead of flushing money down the toilet as a renter. LaToya purchased her 1st home back in the early 2000’s with little direction.  It took a lot courage, an optimistic mindset, belief and a strong support system for her to take that leap. 1st time home buyers are still taking those leaps this day to fulfill their dreams with very little guidance or resources. As a natural educator, she wants to share her knowledge and skills by helping current and future homeowners make more informed decisions.

LaToya's purpose is to Build Dreams One Home At a Time by educating future and current homeowners of the current market trends, financing options, home buyer grant programs, how to build equity and share successful marketing strategies to sell homes fast while developing lifelong relationships.",LaToya Dix,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1668935645/50105531929f3a049d64b54760bd84c0a-e0s.jpg,(317) 873-5554,(317) 514-8735

Here is a testimonial from one of my buyers; ""Corinne and I were very impressed with your work ethic. It is very nice to know that when the time comes we have a realtor and friend in our corner. I appreciate everything you have helped me with throughout this process. I honestly am not sure I would have gone through with buying a house at this time if you were not my realtor. Corinne and I are thrilled with our new house."" JB  Recently (5/15), John and Corrine contact me to list this same home. We sold it in one weekend realizing a nice gain over the five years they owned the home. If you are thinking about buying or selling real estate it doesn't cost you a dime to call, text, email or have coffee with me (I will buy) and tap into a resource that does this day in and day out. I am positive I will provide you with at least one nugget of information that will assist you with your future real estate decisions and hopefully much more.

13,337 N WASHINGTON ST,DANVILLE,"APPROACH 

My approach is very simple! I answer my phone, I do exactly what I say, and I treat every purchase or sale as if it were my own! Working with a sense of urgency is what makes the difference in the market and fighting for every penny is what I do for every single client! I’m passionate about my career and at the end of the day you either get it done or you don’t...nothing in between really matters! I am serious about my business and I simply get it done! 

I know that if I truly serve my clients best interest instead of chasing a commission, my clients WILL see that, and a great, mutually beneficial relationship will be built! My client reaches their goal of finding the perfect home and I earn an honest living that supports my family. Every transaction is an opportunity for a long lasting relationship! :) 

BACKGROUND 

I’ve been in real estate since April of 2014. I started primarily working with national investment companies to keep their portfolio’s occupied with tenants, so I am an expert when it comes to residential leasing and property management. I’ve since branched out into traditional real estate buying and selling as well as investing, credit repair/resolution services, lending and financial services. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

I strives to use my ambition to love and serve my family and others, to learn, grow, and improve myself and those around me. I’m encouraged by hard and smart work to ensure progress, prosperity, and the time to enjoy life. My greatest accolade is my family. I’m grateful that I get to be the husband of my beautiful wife Caitlin and the father to my amazing children Ezra & Eden. I believe all the good I experience in my life is a direct result of my personal relationship with God the father through my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!",Mickey Russo,https://ap.rdcpix.com/af51bfd9366371f14ebd551626435907a-e2720567875s.jpg,(239) 351-1587

I have owned several rental properties over the years along with countless personal properties and projects, mostly ""fixer uppers"". I have lived in several areas around Chicago and Indiana, and have been settled in the Indianapolis area since 2006.

In the mid 90's through early 2000's I worked for a private investor acquiring run down properties and managing all aspects to get the property ""sell ready"". That's how I got my nickname ""The House Stalker"". 

In 2008 I decided to work for myself and get my Real Estate license and use all my house knowledge to help people achieve home ownership. I can give seller's a selling advantage by seeing problems with their homes before it even goes live on the market. I can advise and properly prepare sellers to get the maximum profit, typically with little costs to do so. It's my belief that my sellers appreciate my straightforward, no nonsense approach and strong work ethic.

Every listing begins with a discussion of your goals in selling your home. We then move to a guided tour of your home so I can learn not only what makes it special to you, but what features I can use to maximize interest. We will discuss open houses, make arrangements for a professional photographer for the best listing, and a consultation with a professional stager which I provide with every listing… all at no charge to you.

Representing both buyers and sellers, I’m a veteran of more than two decades in the greater Indianapolis real estate market. I know it well, from the historic districts downtown to the suburbs of Hamilton County and beyond.
I’ve overseen sales for first-time home buyers and seasoned veterans, tiny single-family dwellings to premium luxury homes and sprawling farms. Among my specialties is VIP relocation services with a concierge approach.
With every client I encounter, my goal is the same: to find them the best property or buyer possible, and to make the transaction they best they’ve ever experienced.
I work to communicate with the client to precisely understand their needs and wishes, then use my knowledge of the marketplace to find a solution tailored to their individual property goals. I strive to secure the best deal possible that meets the needs of both parties.
Over the years, I’ve been blessed to enjoy a large volume of repeat business and referrals. It is always the greatest compliment when a past client refers someone. I feel as though I’ve done my job, and done it well. On a number of occasions, I’ve sold the same house I helped a family buy years earlier.
I started my career in the automotive industry, working as service manager at local dealerships before seguing into real estate in 1997. Anyone who knows me is aware I’m a certified car nut.

19,12310 BRIDGEWATER RD,INDIANAPOLIS,"As an Indiana Real Estate Broker and a member of the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors (MIBOR), I work with home buyers and sellers as a partner with my mother in Smith Family Realty.  As a company we consistently strive to offer “Personal and Professional Service from start to finish” and I am passionate about assisting first time home buyers and sellers understand and enjoy the residential real estate buying and/or selling process.

After graduating from IU Bloomington, I was an elementary school teacher. While I was still teaching, I decided to take a leap of faith in my professional life and study to become a realtor. Growing up around real estate (both of my parents were realtors), as well as working for my mother throughout college, allowed me to learn the business firsthand over many years. These experiences inspired me to continue the family tradition by following my passion of discovering homes for clients.  I earned my Indiana Real Estate Broker License in August of 2018 and have since been a Realtor in Central Indiana.

After teaching for over 5 years, I made the decision in January of 2020, to not return for the 2020-2021 school year and pursue real estate full time. Although this was a difficult decision, I believe it was meant to be. Now, I am still able to use my skills of educating others, by guiding clients through the home buying and selling process. This has allowed to follow my passion for real estate and serve others as a full-time realtor in Central Indiana. In 2021, a new era for my mother, Paula Smith, and me begins. We are incredibly excited to take this next step in our real  estate career by launching Smith Family Realty this year.

As an Indianapolis native and a real estate professional, I’ve fallen in love with my Broad Ripple & Midtown Community. I value the trust that clients place in me and strive to serve and educate them on the residential real estate process. Smith Family Realty will always strive every day to exceed our client’s expectations. My enthusiasm for helping others, dedication, hard work, and perseverance help me connect with clients and provide them with the best possible industry service.

My husband and I started investing in real estate in 1993 and I was licensed in 2003.

On the weekends, if not working, you can find me  with my church, researching genealogy, watching sports and planning my next travel destination.  I do LOVE getting away to see new places but I always enjoy coming home to Indy!

Unique about how I work for you?

As a buyer agent:

I listen to your ideal dream for your next home and the activities you enjoy and strive to find that home and neighborhood in that price point that works for you.  Also important is preparing your financial picture so we market you well to the seller and then once under contract, I am focused on your inspection, negotiating that and your appraisal process to closing.  

As a listing agent:

- Team work with a lot of Admin Support and Marketing.
-I hire professional photographer to shoot your home photos.
-I host an Open House quickly and strategically to expose your home to more of the market.
-I work to hopefully bring multiple offers to you to choose from, contact those agents and the lenders to verify the soundness of each offer and assist in evaluating those offers.
- I then work at negotiating through the inspection report/response and ‘selling’ the home basically again to buyers
-Then I work at ‘selling’ the home again to the appraiser to share all the reasons why the home is worth what a willing buyer is ready to pay for it.","Charlene B Brown, CRS",https://ap.rdcpix.com/1783321088/3f42295d8428429385d08085808cf5e9a-c0s.jpg,(317) 331-1810

I have worked in every industry from fast food to manufacturing to short term lending. In 2001, I had the opportunity to move from South Carolina to Indiana with a company that I had been with for 7 years. Although the winters are cold, I found that Indiana has so much to offer! In 2006, my husband and I bought our first home. We really enjoyed looking at homes, exploring the different neighborhoods and learning the meanings of words that we'd never heard of. Although it was an exciting time, it was also very stressful. We were new to the process and there was so much to learn. Several years after the purchase of our home, in the 2008 recession, I decided to take a leap into Real Estate. I ultimately knew there were things that I could do to help people make their real estate experience a little less stressful and would survive one of the worst real estate times in history. Each year I find myself even more excited, motivated and determined. I am continually changing and adjusting my marketing as the real estate market changes but never lose focus of the basics.

13,10150 Lantern Rd,Fishers,"Starting back in 2013 I began my journey investing in real estate.  At that time I was new to the Indianapolis area but through raw determination and serious effort I completed nearly 200 deals in my first few years as a real estate investor. I learned something very important during that time: helping others buy or sell houses benefits everyone involved. We all win! So, I slowly transitioned into helping other clients buy, sell, or invest in properties that suit their needs and goals.

My passion for real estate stems from my own journey as an investor, as well as from my desire to help others achieve financial security. I leverage my skills in social networking, real estate transactions, and customer service to provide honest, professional, and personalized service to each client. I also apply the leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities that I developed as a medical specialist, infantryman, and team leader in the U.S. Army for five years. 

My mission is to deliver value, quality, and results to every client and partner that I work with. My roots in real estate began as a wholesaler who bought and sold houses with very little money. I had to learn as I went. As the deals got bigger and better I continued to grow myself. I was able to complete several flips, two rental properties, and close more transactions than I can count at this point. My ability to find deals for my clients is what separates me from my peers. We make deals happen! It takes work and some creative strategies of thinking outside the box in our current day and age.

After consecutive years of growth as Sales Manager, Justin was appointed COO. In only a couple years, the team went from serving 100 clients a year to nearly 150 clients a year.

He uses the latest Internet marketing tools to sell your present home and/or find you a new home. Working for a photography store for 12 years, his home pictures are way above average.  Going the extra mile… Tim had out of state clients who were looking for a house in the metropolitan area. They had found one that they had liked but had not made any decisions. They asked Tim if he would go and take pictures of the house and send them. Tim shot a video of the inside and outside of the house and sent it to them. Because of the video, it saved them another trip to Indianapolis from Connecticut and they bought the house.Over a 6 month period, Tim sold a short sale home never meeting the owner. He talked to her about 3 times on the phone. Her preference for communications was text messages. There were dozens and dozens and dozens…Tim is a patience person. Tim met a person over the internet who wanted to know what his house was worth. He met him at a local restaurant and discussed the matter. They hit it off well and became friends. The owner lived in Pike Township but worked in Bloomington. Shortly after the meeting he moved to Bloomington and rented the house in Pike Township, Shortly after that he quit the job in Bloomington and got a job in Indianapolis. He now lives in Bloomington and commutes to Indy. At that point he decided he wanted to do some house investing in Bloomington.  He wanted to use Tim as the Realtor. Although Bloomington is not in the MIBOR MLS system, information would be difficult to get and Bloomington was an hour away, Tim said yes. Since then Tim has sold his Bloomington buyer 3 houses and made lots of contacts for real estate information in the area.

12,5868 E 71ST ST STE E-609,INDIANAPOLIS,"ABOUT ME
Hello! Rather than boring you with a boilerplate bio, allow me to present...

""Top Ten Reasons to Work with MIchelle""
1) Problem Solving Mindset: To say I am passionate about problem solving is an understatement. Seriously, it can take over my thoughts for hours! For you that means, that if there is a will, I will do everything within my power to find a way!
2) Whole Person Approach: You are unique and I want to get to know you -- your personality, your values, your preferences, your dreams, and your needs both presently and in the future as it relates to the buying or selling of your home!
3) Marketing: If I had a dollar for every time a real esate agent has poorly marketed a property, I'd be extremely wealthy and super annoyed. The presentation of a home online and in person is critical to creating value for that home. I give thought into every picture that is displayed and every description written. In addition, I work diligiently alongside you to create an experience within the home that takes into account your desired selling price and timeframe while balancing your financial, time, and physical capabilities.
4) Coaching and Guidance: Every step of the way I am there with you! Ultimately, I cannot make any decision for you,. My goal is that we develop a rapport that includes a trust so that you know I am in your corner 100%!
5) Honesty and Integrity: Always - PERIOD. These are non-negotiables for me in all areas of my life.
6) Interest in Design and Architecture: Some people like paintings and sculptures, I like furniture and houses! A well laid out space with design elements that speak to me literally makes me giddy!
7) Cares About Your Experience: You matter! Chances are whether it is buying, selling, or both, it's big deal! There are stressful forces beyond my control and I will do my absolute best to prepare you for what to expect throughout the process, navigate the rare or unforseen, and communicate with you along the way. Not gonna lie, sometimes situations come up that send my heart racing. However, my job is to take a beat and respond versus reacting to those situations. That takes practice and at the end of the day can ultimately determine whether a transaction closes or falls apart.
8) Knowledge and Experience: 27 year resident of Central Indiana, over 16 years of industry related experience including sales for a custom builder, production support at a home remodeling company, residential relocation and referral services, and over 12 years as a Realtor®. I actively participate in learning opportunities offered by my company, related vendors, local and national Realtor® boards, and am on track to receive my Master Professional Certification (MPRO) in 2023!
9) Dollars and Sense: We all want to be happy with our homes and realistically money is a part of that. There is no crystal ball to predict exactly what will happen in the future though you can rest assured that I am looking out for your financial well-being in this regard. My Sale to List Price Average is 100%. During the Covid years it was above that and during the years following the 2008 crash, it was around 98%. I pay close to attention to details that are important not only to you, but to buyers and sellers in general. The national real esate market is important to take note of and keep in mind. However, real estate really is local and that's where I focus most of my energy.
10) You'll Have Some Fun: Spending hundreds of thousands of dollars should be kinda fun, right?!?! From dabbling in standup to dad jokes to lots of improv classes & performances to making my Jazzercise class laugh while they were sweating, laughing and having a good time rank high for me!

And for good measure, a groaner dad joke. I'll save the real comedy for later.

I enjoy interacting with people and pride myself on my quality of service. After leaving the hospitality industry I wanted to continue working with the public and making a difference in their lives, so I transitioned to real estate and earned my license in 2006.

I've discovered that real estate satisfies my passion for service while utilizing  my strengths and skills developed in the hospitality industry. To date, I have received the Five Star Real Estate Agent award for overall client satisfaction, not once, but seven times - 2011, 2102, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Home buyers and sellers determine the recipients, and fewer than 2% of Realtors achieve this honor!

Needless to say, I am here for you ! As your real estate agent, I will help you to understand the entire process of buying and selling a home. Even if you have bought and sold before, it is always wise to be aware of the ever changing world of real estate. It is with due diligence that I keep myself current on license law and other issues to pass on to you.

If you need to see fifty houses before you find your dream home, then that's what we'll do! There is nothing more gratifying to me than sitting next to happy, satisfied clients at the closing table. And I'm especially grateful when they refer to their family and friends.

An IU Business Graduate and small business owner, I specialize in the sale of new and existing homes in the Indianapolis area, with a special emphasis in Northern Marion County and Hamilton County.  I work with first time home buyers, move up buyers, downsizing buyers, investors, and relocations.  

Providing excellent customer service and guiding you through every step of buying or selling a home comes naturally to me. After graduating college, I put my Business degree to good use and opened up specialty nutrition retail stores in the Indianapolis area. Building stores from scratch instilled a deep understanding of how important it is to listen and respect each and every customer and their unique needs and circumstances, and working together to find solutions. 

I have been very fortunate to build many long term friendships and grow an ever expanding network of loyal clients and referrals through my interactions from both my nutrition store years, and now with real estate.

Why I'm Different

I am a full time real estate agent. Actually, much more than full time. I work early mornings, evenings and weekends; whenever is convenient for my client. I love what I do, so quite often it really doesn't feel like work. Don't ever hesitate to call me, anytime!

My philosophy about real estate is that I am here to help two parties (buyer and seller) find each other and complete a transaction with a minimum of fuss and headache. I am known for outstanding customer service, consistent communication, strong attention to detail, and educating my client through every step of the transaction.

4,1425 E 86TH ST STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"I graduated from Bradley University with a degree in graphic design. Although I started my career in the field of marketing, I've always had a passion for homes. I love to walk through a house and visualize the changes that would bring out its full potential and beauty. I've owned and renovated many houses so I know the rewarding experience of making a house feel like home. After 10 years as a successful graphic designer, I turned my passion for homes into a career and became a full-time realtor. Since the day I became a licensed Realtor, I haven't looked back. The greatest gift is to do what you truly love everyday and I feel really fortunate to have a job that allows me to do this. Real estate has always been my passion...it just took me a little while to realize it should also be my career. 

My experience in marketing and design gives me useful skills that set me apart from other agents. I have a keen eye for composition and color that is necessary for home staging and flipping. My knowledge of renovation and construction is a real attribute when searching for that home that is a diamond in the rough. I have extensive knowledge of the Indianapolis area and will help you find just the right home for you. I also have 6+ years of personal flipping experience and I love working with investors.  

Exceptional personal service is the goal that I strive to exceed everyday. I know that buying or selling a home can be stressful.

3,8220 E. 106th Street,Indianapolis,"Whether you are a prospective buyer or seller I will always do my best to represent you in a professional manner and achieve the best results for you that are possible.  I have an excellent marketing background due to my previous career as a retail buyer and merchandise manager, and also am proficient at helping you stage your home.  Plus, due to the number of years I spent negotiating in the NY and L.A marketplace, my negotiation skills are top notch. During my first year in real estate I was ""listing agent of the month"" for my office. I take my career seriously and thus take my clients seriously as well.  I will listen to your needs as a seller and wants as a buyer.  I have excellent communication skills which help move the transaction along.  I am committed to keeping you informed every step of the way via phone calls or emails----whichever you prefer.  I find this career very rewarding because houses help fulfill people's dreams and I achieve a great feeling of satisfaction when I see my clients receive the keys to their new homes.  As your buyer's agent I will consistently look to find you only the properties that you are truly interested in.  I will find out what is most important to you concerning location, school districts, architectural style as well as the ovbious such as price and number of rooms.  I will keep you apprised of price changes on homes you have look at previously, and will also keep you informed about new listings on the market.  I will help you negotiate the best price possible when it is time to make an offer and help guide you through the inspection process when that time comes.  I will be at the closing with you in case there are any unforseen issues and to make sure that everything is as it should be right up until the keys are handed over to you.  In short, I will answer any questions you may have, and if I do not know the answer, will find it out for you as quickly as possible. Conversely, sometimes it is time to sell a home for a number of reasons.  As your listing agent I will help guide you through the process and promise to provide timely feedback from the agents who have shown your home and help you to the best of my ability by giving you pertinent staging suggestions. Staging can make a world of difference in the price you receive for you home.  Generally it does not have to involve a huge dollar investment--- if any. But the results can be unbelievable!  I will provide you with checklists to make the entire process easier at each step of the transaction. At the beginning of the process I will provide you with an in depth ""comparative market analysis"" and explain the document to you, in order that your house will be priced right from the ""get go"".  Since the majority of listings get the most action the first 30 days, it is imperative to get your property priced correctly on ""Day 1"" of your listing contract. Plus your listings will be seen on many different websites, where todays home shoppers are searching first.  I will also market your home to other agents in the real estate business.

Carmel Drive,Carmel,"If you are searching for a dedicated real estate professional who is systematic, thorough and committed to providing personalized, detail-oriented service, look no further.  I’ll provide resources, advice and guidance to help find a top-notch home inspector, lender, the qualified buyer who loves your house, the perfect house in your target neighborhood or the builder that has your ideal floor plan. All while keeping your sanity intact and minimizing the bumps along the way.

For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in residential building and real estate.  My husband and I have lived in three different neighborhoods in the Carmel/Westfield area and also have experience in building our own home, which gives me plenty of first hand knowledge of the ups and downs of the buying/selling/building process from the client’s prospective! 

I came to the real estate profession with a wealth of experience from the areas of medicine, community volunteerism, education and parenthood. The common thread tying all of these seemingly unrelated fields together is the fact that I love to help people achieve their goals.

After retiring from my medical practice, I volunteered in the community with a number of organizations including the Indianapolis Children’s Choir. Even though my daughters have long graduated from the choir, I continue to volunteer as co-chair of a fund raising committee.  I have also been a self-employed high school science tutor and “Brain Game”/Academic Team co-coach at University High School in Carmel. 

While I enjoyed my various previous careers, and certainly bring skills I learned from each of them, I wanted a career where my “helper” personality combined with my well-honed organizational approach, passion and energy could be of benefit to clients finding their way in the real estate arena.

20,8555 RIVER RD STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"Many years ago, the scientist, Edward Lorenz, set out to prove that very small changes, such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings, can have tremendous results. His theory proved that the slightest amount of air movement in certain conditions could in fact be the start of a hurricane weeks later. This isn't to say that butterflies start hurricanes but it is a good reminder to us that changing one thing, can truly change everything. This is something that I try really hard to keep top of mind. I know that the life events that cause you to change where you live, have tremendous life changing outcomes. I also keep in mind that when I am marketing your home or helping you negotiate a transaction, or researching data for you, that every little detail matters and has a huge impact on the process. We believe that everything we say, everything we do, every moment matters. And sometimes, its the littlest things that matter most. 

So when you are making one of the biggest decisions of your life, just know that I am with you 100% recognizing the importance, and balancing the fragility of all that matters most to you with Effective, Positive, Results.

7,643 Massachusetts Ave.,Indianapolis,"My love for all things real estate began the same way as so many other real estate professionals in the industry:  With a house flip.  What first began as a fun project with quickly became a passion.  Once I completed my second flip, I was completely obsessed with the entire real estate market and process. I worked tirelessly to soak up as much knowledge about not only the real estate industry, but what it took to become a successful real estate agent.  After becoming a licensed real estate agent, I spent nine years working in a boutique brokerage firm, where I assisted with property management, listing inventory, and worked as a buyer’s agent and new home construction expert.  Even after receiving two degrees, including an MBA from Anderson University, there was nothing else I wanted to do for a career other than work in real estate.

At C21, I was given the opportunity to share my passion, knowledge, and experience with other real estate agents – helping them develop skills and strategies that would empower them to become a more productive advocate for their clients.  As the resident emotional cheerleader of the C21 team, I bring my sunny disposition, unbridled optimism, and empathetic ear to everything I do, and am grateful for the time I spend with my team and the agents I’m coaching.

When I’m not building up real estate agents, I’m building my family and guiding my most precious asset, my two daughters.  I also love to work out and attempt new PRs during my workout sessions.

10,9801 FALL CREEK RD # 223,INDIANAPOLIS,"I am a 3rd generation, life long resident of Indianapolis with the exception of my collegiate years and military service. I came from the outside of real estate via the appraisal route and the practice of law. In 1992-93 I became disenchanted being an appraiser as I was marginalized for not providing appraised values which were required in order to keep appraisal accounts. Additionally, I had mastered the skills of determining value and marketability.

In the course of my appraisal experience I came to realize that even before the beginnings of the real estate fraud perpetrated upon this country got going, that buyers and sellers were in need of a higher level of service and skill than was seemingly available or being delivered. My goal is that you make an informed and knowing decision as a buyer and a seller.  I explain and show you the market in which you are competing.  You can monitor it with me while I sell your home if you want.  When I am selling your home you will know what I am doing, why I am doing it, and when it gets done.  I represent buyers and sellers who want to be represented. You are a client, not a customer.  I suppose I will also represent you if you don’t really want to know what is going on. 😊

It is not whether your home sells, it will.  It is how it sells.  The number of issues between deciding to buy or sell or both are myriad.  The include, with multiple sub issues under each of these: appraisal, financing, timing of closing, alternative housing, school choices, title issues, environmental issues, inspection/repair issues, legal issues (see my website: war stories tab). When selling your home you need someone who knows what should be done, what has to be done, and what is not necessary to be done in order to prepare your home for exposure to the rigors of your competitive market. You also need to know how to get it done.  I come with a full complement of contractors in whom i have faith born of personal experience.  I monitor their work and progress.  I have surprised myself at how good I have become at interior decor.  I thank my wife for that but I take credit for being a quick learner and ""getting it"". 

When buying a home I put you through your paces. I am a fan of looking...a lot! I want you to crystallize and distill your thought processes of what exactly you want the home to do for you and to help you arrive at what it should do for you in terms of how you actually live your lives. I want you to know what factors drive value and marketability in your chosen area to live. You should also know how your home will perform as a financial asset. When you finally make a buying decision, if I have done my job right, we will all know at the same time and we should all know why when we find THE home.

One of the things that I also make it my business to be involved, and to which I have concluded is not common place in our industry, is financing. I make sure that you are not being taken advantage of by your mortgage originator and that the financing process gets done the way it should be done and done in the time frame in which it needs to be done. I also ensure my sales don't fall apart because of an inability to get financing or from failure to appraise.

I still selectively take a legal case or two.  I keep up on the law but overwhelmingly I help buyers and sellers like you.  For you the buyer or seller, the benefits of my legal knowledge and experience are more in the nature of prophylactic I have learned that it is so much cheaper/easier to prevent a problem than it is fix a problem.

There is not any aspect of the industry that I do not do at an expert level. If you can find a Realtor who owned a title company,, started a mortgage company, performed appraisals for major banks and lenders, actively practiced law but has represented buyers and sellers for over 30 years, my advice is to use them.  From marketing to negotiating, to staging and financing. If you want a qualitatively different real estate experience feel free to contact me. I would be happy to chat with you.",Merrill Moores,http://ap.rdcpix.com/1977735718/c435a1ce6bb99a906786994a121c7a99a-c0md-r1.jpg,(317) 290-7711

4,8555 RIVER RD STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"A lifelong resident of the Indianapolis area, I suppose it was my destiny to be in Real Estate.  I prepared for my real estate career by living all over central Indiana, familiarizing myself with different homes and neighborhoods.  I grew up in Washington Township on the north side of Marion County.  After four glorious years at Indiana University, I lived in Clay Township in Hamilton County; lived in Brown Township in Hendricks County; lived in Franklin Township on the south side of Marion County, and lived in Lawrence Township on the east side of Marion County.  While I was becoming acquainted with the four corners of central Indiana, I started my adult working life with our small, family business that I watched grow from the time I was a child.  After nearly 30 years, the family business was sold and I discovered the other side of the pendulum, working a few years for a Fortune 500 company that was ranked in the top 50.  Nearly all of my working life I’ve been around existing homes, new construction, builders and realtors in one form or another.  I found I enjoyed working with smaller, more personal businesses best.

Technology is obviously much more advanced, clients now have the ability to review different sites and select the homes that they want to view instead of having the Realtor select for them. They can  electronically sign their signatures when they are ready to list or to purchase their home, and even review the homes history and past owners from the privacy of their kitchen tables.

As I reflect back over the past 20 years, I'm positive of what has not changed, at least not for me. First and foremost is my passion for this business!  My desire to meet new people each and every day and the opportunity to learn about their past  journey and what phase of life they are currently entering.  I believe the ""relationship"" part of our business is imperative in assisting my clients to find just the right home that fits all their families wants and needs.  I have been blessed to be able to work in my field of choice for the past 20 years and I truly believe its because of my commitment to treat each and every client as if they were my own family, more especially the way I would want to be treated if I were walking in their shoes.

0,22 S State St,Greenfield,"Hi, my name is Mario Robleto. I am originally from the far-eastside of Indianapolis and recently I have come back to Indy after having lived abroad in Latin America for 14+ years. During my time abroad I studied Law in Latin America and for almost 10 years advised clients investing in the region on various legal and commercial aspects of their business. I continue to advise clients interested in investing in Latin America, specifically Central America, but now to a lesser degree.
Now that I have returned to Indy, I have with great enthusiasm decided to focus on a career in real estate, specifically in single-family residential homes in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. Since beginning this endeavor, I have been pleasantly surprised in seeing how well my years of experience from my time in the legal profession in advising businesses can now be applied assisting individuals and families that are either buying their first home or selling a home in Indianapolis to make this process as simple and straightforward as possible for them.
On a personal note, I now own a home in Indianapolis on the north-eastside of town where I live with my wonderful wife who I have been married to for now 8+ years and our 2 young children, Anthony and Nathan and our sweet little puppy, Tobi.",Mario Robleto,https://ap.rdcpix.com/663a5383b3886f836574e335638c8189a-e34036934s.jpg,(317) 339-6290

0,1425 E 86TH ST STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"I was born and raised on the east side of Indianapolis, Indiana along with three siblings, and was greatly influenced by my father.  He was a very creative man who inspired me to learn as much about business as I possibly could from a very early age.  He also encouraged me to express myself through art, writing and inventing, and instilled within me the ability to not be afraid to step ‘outside of the box,’ and to focus my sights beyond the status quo.

As I look back upon my life’s journey thus far, my most important and rewarding experience and accomplishment in life has been the raising of my family, Stephanie, Tyler and Paige and Brooklyn.
Once my family members were grown, I took a good look in the mirror and decided that it was time to devote some attention to my personal growth, so I elected to go back to college and attended Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis, where I studied public relations on a full-time basis.  I also attended Herron School of Art & Design and the Liberal Arts school for creative writing.  Being one that possesses a desire to continue to learn, I’m expanding my skills in the luxury home market, as well as attending a University to learn about trading on the stock market, as well.

Today, I’m extremely passionate about my real estate career and the people that I work with and I have a burning desire to help people.  I love to help my customers and clients achieve as well as exceed their desired goals, and I always strive to deliver to them more than they expect.  I attribute that mindset to my father, as I mentioned, instilling within me the importance of exceeding the status quo.  It’s the cornerstone of my business philosophy.
I’m blessed to be a part of the RE/MAX Indy Home Pros family, one of the most recognizable brand names in the world.

I am a native of Mississippi and have lived in Indiana since 1995.  My husband and I live in Westfield, IN. Our two boys attended Westfield Washington Public Schools.  I believe work-life balance is EXTREMELY important.  While I admit that much of my work is inspired by a desire to support others, I enjoy carving out quiet time for family (including our golden doodles), running, vacationing in Jamaica, meditating, reading, and listening to reggae music.  
 
My path to real estate is not traditional nor without a few stops along the way.  I offer more than twenty years of accomplishments in public education, law, program development, and teacher training.  After working for three years as an attorney/mediator in Hamilton County Courts facilitating mortgage workout agreements between homeowners and banks, I added real estate broker to my work to maximize my potential to better support buyers and sellers in realizing their residential dreams.

I merge the skills and knowledge of negotiation, contract and real estate rules, advocacy, adult coaching, and realty to ensure that all details have been considered when helping clients make good purchasing and selling decisions in today’s real estate market.  My natural work style incorporates listening closely to my client’s needs and supporting the development of a plan tailored to keep clients informed, engaged, and confident that his/her interests are the driving force behind WardHolloway Real Property’s efforts. 

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology Education from Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi in 1990; a Master Degree in Science Education from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio in 1995; EdS from Indiana State University in 2017, and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence at Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis in 2010.

I've also moved cross country multiple times and have helped others stretch beyond their comfort zones making BOLD moves in to new areas and lifestyles.

2,4000 W 106 Th St 125 265,Carmel,"Cunningham Group Concierge Realty Fred Cunningham ~ Paula Giovannitti ~  Chastity Nolan

Some years ago we were asking ourselves how we could get to the top of an industry which was 15 years behind technology and full of Big Companies lagging the times.

So, we asked our customers how we were doing and what would they like to see.
     It came out the same as other great businesses:  We present to people what they want, when the want and we do it with care.

Then we left the big brokerages (and their high fees) to open Cunningham Concierge Realty.   (Of course we made sure our technology is cutting edge).

The large majority of our transactions come through referrals and repeat business. The rest are young people looking for their first home.

Try us.   You'll like it.",Fred Cunningham,http://p.rdcpix.com/v04/af2900f00-c0l.jpg,(317) 514-5098,(317) 507-0376

0,22 S State St,Greenfield,"Hi, my name is Mario Robleto. I am originally from the far-eastside of Indianapolis and recently I have come back to Indy after having lived abroad in Latin America for 14+ years. During my time abroad I studied Law in Latin America and for almost 10 years advised clients investing in the region on various legal and commercial aspects of their business. I continue to advise clients interested in investing in Latin America, specifically Central America, but now to a lesser degree.
Now that I have returned to Indy, I have with great enthusiasm decided to focus on a career in real estate, specifically in single-family residential homes in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. Since beginning this endeavor, I have been pleasantly surprised in seeing how well my years of experience from my time in the legal profession in advising businesses can now be applied assisting individuals and families that are either buying their first home or selling a home in Indianapolis to make this process as simple and straightforward as possible for them.
On a personal note, I now own a home in Indianapolis on the north-eastside of town where I live with my wonderful wife who I have been married to for now 8+ years and our 2 young children, Anthony and Nathan and our sweet little puppy, Tobi.",Mario Robleto,https://ap.rdcpix.com/663a5383b3886f836574e335638c8189a-e34036934s.jpg,(317) 339-6290

0,1425 E 86TH ST STE 200,INDIANAPOLIS,"I was born and raised on the east side of Indianapolis, Indiana along with three siblings, and was greatly influenced by my father.  He was a very creative man who inspired me to learn as much about business as I possibly could from a very early age.  He also encouraged me to express myself through art, writing and inventing, and instilled within me the ability to not be afraid to step ‘outside of the box,’ and to focus my sights beyond the status quo.

As I look back upon my life’s journey thus far, my most important and rewarding experience and accomplishment in life has been the raising of my family, Stephanie, Tyler and Paige and Brooklyn.
Once my family members were grown, I took a good look in the mirror and decided that it was time to devote some attention to my personal growth, so I elected to go back to college and attended Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis, where I studied public relations on a full-time basis.  I also attended Herron School of Art & Design and the Liberal Arts school for creative writing.  Being one that possesses a desire to continue to learn, I’m expanding my skills in the luxury home market, as well as attending a University to learn about trading on the stock market, as well.

Today, I’m extremely passionate about my real estate career and the people that I work with and I have a burning desire to help people.  I love to help my customers and clients achieve as well as exceed their desired goals, and I always strive to deliver to them more than they expect.  I attribute that mindset to my father, as I mentioned, instilling within me the importance of exceeding the status quo.  It’s the cornerstone of my business philosophy.
I’m blessed to be a part of the RE/MAX Indy Home Pros family, one of the most recognizable brand names in the world.

I am a native of Mississippi and have lived in Indiana since 1995.  My husband and I live in Westfield, IN. Our two boys attended Westfield Washington Public Schools.  I believe work-life balance is EXTREMELY important.  While I admit that much of my work is inspired by a desire to support others, I enjoy carving out quiet time for family (including our golden doodles), running, vacationing in Jamaica, meditating, reading, and listening to reggae music.  
 
My path to real estate is not traditional nor without a few stops along the way.  I offer more than twenty years of accomplishments in public education, law, program development, and teacher training.  After working for three years as an attorney/mediator in Hamilton County Courts facilitating mortgage workout agreements between homeowners and banks, I added real estate broker to my work to maximize my potential to better support buyers and sellers in realizing their residential dreams.

I merge the skills and knowledge of negotiation, contract and real estate rules, advocacy, adult coaching, and realty to ensure that all details have been considered when helping clients make good purchasing and selling decisions in today’s real estate market.  My natural work style incorporates listening closely to my client’s needs and supporting the development of a plan tailored to keep clients informed, engaged, and confident that his/her interests are the driving force behind WardHolloway Real Property’s efforts. 

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology Education from Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi in 1990; a Master Degree in Science Education from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio in 1995; EdS from Indiana State University in 2017, and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence at Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis in 2010.

I've also moved cross country multiple times and have helped others stretch beyond their comfort zones making BOLD moves in to new areas and lifestyles.  I have a clear understanding of the details involved with getting to the finish line no matter where it may be or what type of Dream Home you are looking for.

2,4000 W 106 Th St 125 265,Carmel,"Cunningham Group Concierge Realty Fred Cunningham ~ Paula Giovannitti ~  Chastity Nolan

Some years ago we were asking ourselves how we could get to the top of an industry which was 15 years behind technology and full of Big Companies lagging the times.

So, we asked our customers how we were doing and what would they like to see.
     It came out the same as other great businesses:  We present to people what they want, when the want and we do it with care.

Then we left the big brokerages (and their high fees) to open Cunningham Concierge Realty.   (Of course we made sure our technology is cutting edge).

The large majority of our transactions come through referrals and repeat business. The rest are young people looking for their first home.

Try us.   You'll like it.",Fred Cunningham,http://p.rdcpix.com/v04/af2900f00-c0l.jpg,(317) 514-5098,(317) 507-0376

A true visionary in Indianapolis’ development, Joe has consistently been recognized as a multimillion-dollar producer in buying and selling luxury and up-market real estate. With over 450 million in career sales and well over 21 years experience, Joe opened Everhart Studio to better serve his client base of urban dwellers while promoting the continued development of Indianapolis. As the popularity of city living has burgeoned, his clientele now includes an increasing number of suburbanites who have chosen to change zip codes. 
       Joe’s intimate knowledge of downtown Indy and his first and second ring suburbs developed after spending countless years selling here. He has handled transactions on virtually every street of the city’s celebrated historic and contemporary neighborhoods. The Indianapolis Business Journal consistently lists Joe as a “top 20 agent” out of a field of thousands. No one sold more urban residential real estate last year than Joe Everhart. Over the years, Joe’s reputation as a community leader has also crystalized. He is always the first to offer support to a cause or an ear to a colleague. His civic-mindedness frames the way he approaches his trade. 
       As the Studio grows to meet the needs of clients, Joe has opened an office in Terre Haute. He grew up in Clinton, and most of his family still resides in the area. The opportunity to expand his business to his hometown made sense. Along with a sophisticated cultured eye, Joe brings his clients an unparalleled work ethic. He runs Everhart Studio with a finely tuned mix of business acumen and passion. Joe loves his work, and he has done it 80 hours a week for 25 years.

Being raised in an environment where the merits of an infallible work ethic were paramount while working on my family’s farm from the age of 8 and serving as a partner in what was the nation’s largest privately held RV manufacturer I discovered nothing is as vital as applying the Golden Rule. It’s through this lens that our business was built for sustained success-treating every client, colleague, friend and acquaintance as you would treat your family. Quality in the products you sell and the services you offer create a great environment & satisfied client base. It also brings us the most happiness making the largest impact we can in others’ lives.

Passion for sports and sporting events helped to develop a team-based, competitive approach to Real Estate. After graduating from Indiana University with degrees in Economics and Sports Marketing, I sharpened my ability to deliver impeccable service & develop the confidence to succeed while working for the Indianapolis Colts' Community Relations Department and Division I Men's Basketball Championship at NCAA National HQ. Today I try to take advantage of every opportunity to spend time with my wife, 3 wonderful children and dog Indy. Finding fun ways to ingrain ourselves in the community, enjoying local amenities, passing along favorite hobbies to kids & trying new ones with friends makes life interesting and exciting.

We recognize the importance of successfully navigating your transition while being a steward of your goals. This allow us to maximize results and minimize headaches-whether it's buying for the first time, moving up, downsizing, relocating or investing. We've employed strategies to help buyers and sellers achieve what is most important throughout their transaction. Quality in every deal is something we take personally, and will never sacrifice our standards for quantity. Keeping your best interests front and center, getting to know others on a personal level and treating every sale with the care that it deserves helps to identify & find the home, deal or buyer that's right for you. We realize your transaction is one of the most important decisions in your lifetime and will treat it as such.

Growing up in Kokomo, Indiana, Cathy has always been moved to live her life with humility, care, and service.  Cathy graduated from Ball State University where she studied accounting. While Larry’s real estate career continued to skyrocket, Cathy used her love of customer service and coffee to open and run a popular coffee shop in Zionsville.
Throughout their marriage, Cathy has worked alongside her husband Larry as he has helped countless homeowners and sellers bring their real estate dreams to life – however, it wasn’t until Larry underwent hip-replacement surgery that Cathy finally took the leap into becoming an agent herself.  Wanting to support her husband and the incredible career he had built, she took real estate classes, studied, and became a REALTOR. Since that time, she has helped numerous families, individuals, and investors buy or sell their properties in a smooth, seamless, and worry-free way.  Cathy brings a calming sense of security and confidence into everything she does, and as a real estate agent for nearly a decade, she has used these skills and her passion for helping her clients achieve their real estate dreams. 
In addition to her work, Cathy enjoys spending time with her family, cooking, playing tennis, traveling, and can often be found window shopping throughout Zionsville and exploring quaint cafes and other small businesses.",Cathy Rasmussen,https://ap.rdcpix.com/8096ed13700b599635be212997477cd0a-c2281165842s.jpg,(317) 844-5111,(317) 431-1008

I work with clients to meet THEIR NEEDS, whether that involves a quick sale or requires more time to find just the right home. I grew up and have lived in Hendricks County most of my life. In 2005, I moved just across the county line into western Marion County where I currently reside.  I am the mother of two grown sons who still live in the area.
